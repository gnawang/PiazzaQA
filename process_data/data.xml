Piazza is a QA platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:  1.  <b>Ask questions!</b>  The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).  2.  <b>Edit questions and answers wiki-style.</b>  Think of Piazza as a QA wiki for your class. Every question has just a single <b>students' answer</b> that students can edit collectively (and a single <b>instructors’ answer</b> for instructors).  3.  <b>Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.</b>  To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a <b>followup discussion</b>. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the QA above.  4.  <b>Go anonymous.</b>  Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.  5.  <b>Tag your posts.</b>  It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.  6.  <b>Format code and equations.</b>  Adding a code snippet? Click the <b>pre</b> or <b>tt</b> button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text.  Mathematical equation? Click the <b>Fx</b> button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.  7.  <b>View and download class details and resources.</b>  Click the <b>Course Page</b> button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!   Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at <b>team@piazza.com</b>. We love feedback!

Am I correct in assuming that month 12 (the first month printed) is where we begin accumulating the loan amt, with the balance at month 1 at the bottom being the solution?    And regarding the formula in computing the first month&#39;s balance, principal and interest, exactly how do we work in the given equation of B&#39; = B * (1&#43;r/12) - P seeing how we don&#39;t have any prior knowledge of the previous month&#39;s balance? I initially thought on your first month of paying, it&#39;d begin as $100, and then you&#39;d start multiplying by r/12 every month to calculate interest.

<p>Hi, I&#39;m just wondering whether it is okay to use the book from the Fall 2013 semester for this course? Or is it better to purchase the new book for the upcoming semester?</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Is is okay to use the &lt;cmath&gt; library for the first project.  I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to check if the year is in fact an integer value (for the third call to the GetParam function) without using the &lt;cmath&gt; library.</p>

<p>I have noticed that a few of my numbers always differ in the hundredths place when compared to the test case. When I do calculations for the first month&#39;s interest, (100 * (0.05 / 12 ) ), I get a number that is 0.41666666...., but the output for the interest is 0.41, so the trailing 6&#39;s need to be truncated. However, for other numbers, I have noticed that rounding gave me the correct hundredths place.</p> <p> </p> <p>Which one should I stick to? Is the correct output possible by using only one?</p>

<p>Maybe this doesn&#39;t apply to this first project, but for later projects if we get all &#34;pass&#34; does that mean we are completely correct? Or will even more test cases be tested beyond what the autograder does?</p>

<p>Found 400 tokens in source.<br />if this number significantly exceeds the average reported for all students,<br /> your source code is too bloated and needs to be reduced in size.</p> <p></p> <p>I got this message in the autograder, and I&#39;m not sure what exactly tokens means, nor how this corresponds to the average reported for all students.

<p>Hi all,</p> <p></p> <p>By an unfortunate coincidence, it turns out that a common mistake in the computational procedure for project 1 leads to numbers for the example given in the spec that are very close to the correct ones (off by a few hundredths). Traditionally this has caused a bit of confusion as to whether it could just be a rounding issue, but it does actually mean there is a conceptual mistake in the way your code does the calculations.</p> <p></p> <p>Good luck and happy coding!</p>

<p>Hello,</p> <p></p> <p>The question I have regards an uncertainty I perceive in the project specification. On page 2 it says:</p> <p></p> <p>&#34;Note that you must do a small amount of additional error checking on the &#34;years&#34; input. If the user enters something other than an integer number of years, call GetParam again with the same prompt/limits.&#34;</p> <p></p> <p>Then it says: </p> <p>&#34;You do not need to handle any erroneous input---for example, a user who types &#34;foo&#34; instead of &#34;0.05&#34;. You may assume that we will always supply numbers when they are expected, but that the numbers might be outside the allowable range. &#34;</p> <p></p> <p>According to the io.cpp source file that range error checking is already done for us, so really the only error checking we need to do is the term of the loan being a whole number. Is that correct?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>I am wondering how we turn our projects in.  Once we submit it into the auto grader will you be sent the most recent version? Or is there another place we need to submit it?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>Anyone in the UgLi basement available to answer a few questions about project one?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>In the case of GetParam on duration of the loans, in years, should the program ask for a re-do if the input has a decimal?</p> <p></p> <p>For instance, if someone inputs: 1.0,</p> <p></p> <p>should the program ask for the parameter again, or should it accept the answer, since technically, 1.0 is a whole number and could be considered an integer?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>I&#39;m sorry if it is a silly question, but if we input some characters rather than numbers, the &#34;GetParam&#34; function  would never stop.</p> <p></p> <p>So do we need to consider the &#34;character&#34; problem?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>I am confused by the directions in the project spec.  Do we need to write functions like GetParam() and PrintHeader(), or just include the library the functions are in and write the code where we will call the pre-written functions?  Thanks</p> <p></p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
As I test, I realize that the user can enter a monthly loan with values past the hundredths place (100.324, for example). Should I be considering this possibilty? If so, I&#39;m trying to determine whether it would be best to round up or down in such a case, if only one will considered correct when grading.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>In the auto grader I keep getting:</p> <pre>Build warnings/errors: Build output: g&#43;&#43; -Wall -Werror -pedantic -O1 io.cpp p1.cpp -o p1  Be sure to use -O3 on each compile line<br /><br />and then:<br />Scoring student executable...

<p>Sorry if this is a dumb question, but on the spec the example shows:</p> <div> <div> <div> <pre>Month   Principal        Interest -----   ---------       --------- 12          99.59            0.41 11          99.17            0.83 10          98.76            1.24 9           98.35            1.65 8           97.94            2.06 7           97.54            2.46 6           97.13            2.87 5           96.73            3.27 4           96.33            3.67 3           95.93            4.07 2           95.53            4.47 1           95.13            4.87 </pre> </div> <div> <pre>  Balance ---------     99.59    198.76    297.52    395.87    493.81    591.35    688.48    785.21    881.53    977.46   1072.99   1168.12 </pre> </div> </div> </div> <p></p> <p>So how come the balance starts at 99.59 and not 100?

<p>If the user enters a double are we supposed to just round/floor/cast to an int or do we need a loop to call Getparam again until they get it right? And if so how do we check for it with a loop if we can&#39;t edit the GetParam function itself? I&#39;ve heard people went about this a lot of different ways but I&#39;m still unsure.</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>The specifications say that the years input must be an integer -- does this mean that we must declare the years input as an int?  Or is this direction only referring to the fact that we must call GetParam() again if the user tries to enter a double in (and there is no restriction on the type for the years variable)? </p> <p></p> <p>I had been under the assumption that we were able to declare it as a double at least, but I wanted to make sure I&#39;m not misunderstanding anything.  Thanks!</p>

<p>As a student who was briefly enrolled in 280 previously, I had two quick policy questions. Firstly, I was wondering if I am allowed to use code from projects that I had previously submitted when I was enrolled and, if not, how I should go about trying to avoid unintentionally plagiarizing myself. Secondly I was wondering if I would be allowed to partner with people for projects that occurred after I previously dropped the course. Thank you all in advance for any help you might be able to provide.</p>

<p>I understand how the last equation given in the project file can find you any month&#39;s balance based on the balance of the month after it.

This is not a problem with more reasonable test cases: the code outputs the test example given in the prompt correctly and has passed all of the public tests in the autograder. It also does not occur in every extreme test case (e.g., all output seems to be correct when input is $100,000 monthly payment, 100% annual interest, and 1 year of loan).</p> <p></p> <p>Is this a calculation/rounding problem that I should be concerned about?

<p>Hello, </p> <p></p> <p>I took EECS 280 last semester but ended up dropping it. However, I still did do project 1. I was wondering if I am able to resubmit my previous project 1 file from last semester with slight changes if needed?</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks! </p>

<p>So I am having some issues compiling.

Could it be a result of a long string value being put in for the string argument? This is really my only thought as to what it could be. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

<TEXT>
<p>My error checking for the loan duration weeds out decimals just fine, but whenever I put a fraction in, it passes the test, only using the numerator for the duration. I was thinking about converting duration to a string and using find() to look for a &#39;/&#39; character. Is there an easier way of going about this?</p>

<p>Hey everyone. I can&#39;t find anyone else with this issue, but for some reason I keep getting this error:</p> <p></p> <pre> syntax error near unexpected token &#96;(&#39;</pre> <p>no matter what program I run, be it project 1 or a simple hello world. I can compile just fine, but the error pops up when it tries to run. I don&#39;t have any   &#39;   characters in the code, nor do I have single quotation marks. It also only shows up for the first instance of parentheses, typically the first function.</p> <p></p> <p>I&#39;m not sure why it can&#39;t recognize a parentheses.

I&#39;m working in gedit and using the command line given in the spec. I have the three include statements.

<p>I was looking at the final slide in today&#39;s lecture regarding resource costs of iteration and recursion, and I wasn&#39;t able to draw any specific conclusion.</p> <p></p> <p>What I did find was that</p> <ul><li>both cases involve x multiplications</li><li>the recursive case involves (x&#43;1) stack frames and (x&#43;1) integers</li><li>the iterative case involves (x&#43;1) comparisons, x decrements, one stack frame, and 2 integers</li></ul> <p></p> <p>Did anyone find anything different, and is there any way to verify from this information that one algorithm is superior in regard to resource management? If I had to guess, it seems like iteration would be more efficient when x is sufficiently large because of the number of variables and stack frames that would have to be utilized in the recursive case.

Do we need to go into those files and adjust that or just leave it? Also, will lines that the autograder says are too long be counted against us?</p>

So I was in 183 and haven&#39;t used CAEN besides what we did in discussion so I&#39;m very unfamiliar with all of this. I have my p1.cpp on my CAEN desktop and i&#39;m trying to run it in the terminal but it keeps telling me that the file isn&#39;t in the directory. How do I fix this? I did the cd command of my p1 folder (where p1.cpp is) but that didn&#39;t work, What am I doing wrong? once it&#39;s in my directory how do I start compiling with g&#43;&#43;? I&#39;ve been sifting through the 3 or so pdfs on c tools about this but can&#39;t seem to find the correct answer.

<p>From io.cpp, line 12:</p> <pre>cin &gt;&gt; result;</pre> <p></p> <p>That line of code should pause and wait for user input, regardless of any other circumstances, no? Like the code shouldn&#39;t be going off in an endless loop if it gets to that line, it should stop and wait for the user to press enter before continuing to the next line, right? Or is there something in my p1.cpp file that would cause this line to be skipped in io.cpp?</p> <p></p> <p>The issue I&#39;m having is that, when I enter a number as a fraction, GetParam runs, it displays the prompt then continues to display the same prompt until I ctrl-c out. I slapped in two other cout test statements above and below the line of code displayed above in io.cpp, and it prints both of those out fine (also in an infinite loop when testing fractions). Is there some reason in my io.cpp or the way I&#39;m compiling (I&#39;m using all the proper flags laid out in the spec)?</p> <p></p> <p>Decimals, min, and max all work as intended.</p> <p></p> <p>Oh, and this might also just be a Linux thing, but if I enter 7/32 it treats the input as 7, but if I enter (7/32) it starts having this issue. Is that just how Linux works, or should I be concerned about it not reading the /32 if I don&#39;t have parentheses?</p>

<p>So, I already submitted two times with the autograder. Today.</p> <p></p> <p>The first time, I got fracyears and long test cases failed. So I went back and look some more, change a few things that I think needed to be fixed, and submitted it again. But I still failed some tests.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, I can&#39;t submit no more, in case my submission isn&#39;t the right answer. So I&#39;m wondering, what the heck should I do now?</p> <p></p> <p>When I tested the test1 file using diff, no error showed up. Also, when I input 4.5, 2.3 ...etc. for years, my terminal correctly prompts me for re-input. Hence my question about what fracyears looks for.</p> <p></p> <p>So far, I know that if I input actual fractions as years, the program fails (as in, if I input 3/3 that program doesn&#39;t take that as 1... but from what I read up here I&#39;m supposed to not worry about that case). But I have no idea why I failed the test if my code was able to show no error with inputs such as 4.5 or 2.3.</p> <p></p> <p>Please help! Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello~ I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but I was just seeing if anyone had any real ideas on how to improve the labs, particularly in discussions held in places like the Dental Building. where the internet is terrible and there are no provided computers.</p> <p></p> <p>The problem particularly is that the lab seems to focus on using CAEN Redhat Linux- which is reasonable in itself. However, that requires us to bring our own laptops and use the VNC applications- which relies on the internet. MWireless frankly didn&#39;t work in the Dental Building, although many of us <strong>could</strong> work with the VNC over MGuest. However, there many of us could not, and I heard from a few people that it was slow (and I know someone&#39;s VNC client disconnected/crashed, which means restarting the client and reopening everything).</p> <p></p> <p>I apologize if this note is cumbersome, but can anyone suggest any ideal solutions? I saw the tables had ethernet ports next to the power outlets, but the tables weren&#39;t really connected to anything. There <em>is</em> the possibility of asking a department to refit the entire room with ethernet cables, but that&#39;s, say, 42 cables throughout the room.</p> <p></p> <p>Personally, however, I had little trouble. I dual-booted Ubuntu Linux, downloaded everything, then disconnected from the internet. Dual-booting has its own benefits - ranging from customizability to not relying on CAEN unless software is necessary. However, it also comes with its own disadvantages when put to a large-scale- having to ask students to randomly install some random OS and then make sure they have all the right packages installed (fortunately, many are at least included in the normal Ubuntu installation).</p> <p></p> <p>To put it simply:</p> <p><strong>Problem</strong></p> <p>-&gt; We are expected to use CAEN Linux</p> <p>-&gt; Internet is far too cumbersome for all students to use CAEN VNC</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Solutions(</strong>?)</p> <p>-&gt; Wait until more and more people stop coming, or switch to discussions with better conditions (?)</p> <p>-&gt; Refit the rooms with ethernet cables</p> <p>-&gt; Ask some students to dual-boot with a Linux distribution</p> <p><br />This will probably be quite redundant if the next labs actually <strong>don&#39;t</strong> expect Linux, but I&#39;m curious- will we be focusing on using Linux, and if so, how can we solve that? Also, I guess this isn&#39;t that serious of an issue as many of us will probably just use Visual Studios or such, and then later test it on CAEN. However, would that really help us students in the end?<br /><br />Thanks for considering this, even if I&#39;m over thinking this far, far, far too much~</p>

<p>In &#34;p2-tests.cpp&#34;, the instructions specify that test cases should be placed in their own functions. Is it sufficient to write one abstract test case function for each implemented function, and then call said test function multiple times.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, would it be alright to create a function called &#34;test_sum&#34; which is implemented multiple times in main() to test that the sum function is working correctly? There would then be another similar function for product, accumulate, etc. Or would it be better that each specific test case be placed in their own function (ie &#34;test_sum_empty&#34; would test for an empty list and &#34;test_sum_long&#34; would test a long list)?</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks!</p>

<p>1. About the accumulate() function :</p> <p>In the spec. it use add( ) as an example. So do we need to actually implement whatever associative fn we want to test in the p2-tests.cpp? </p> <p>( I didn&#39;t see related function declared anyplace in the files provided, so I have to write one to test the function, then I have to modify the format of p2-tests.cpp ---- I add the function implementation in p2-tests.cpp. Is that ok?)</p> <p></p> <p>2. I use a lot of helper function in solving the tail-recursion thing. But in the spec. it says it is not a necessity. So I am wondering, for every problem in project2, is there always a solution not using helper function? Or it is the reverse: only small part of the functions can be finished without using a helper function?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Thanks !</p> <p></p>

<p>For functions like <em>reverse</em>, is it sufficient for the test case to print out the original list, and then print out the reverse list and then we can expect the user to be able to check if it did it properly? </p> <p></p> <p>Example: </p> <p><b>Original listA: ( 4 3 2 1 0 )</b></p> <p><b>Reverse listA: ( 0 1 2 3 4 )</b></p> <p><b></b></p> <p>I could see how it would be possible to write functions to automatically check this, but it would require a fair amount of extra code to write one for all the functions. </p> <p></p> <p>Additionally, can we expect any input as to what the standards will be for grading test cases? </p>

<p>In the REM for the rotate function, there is no limitation to the value that n may be assigned.

<p>The example test case notes that I am allowed to use it as a guide for writing future test cases, but am I <em>required</em> to follow it? I&#39;ve found that the given structure can be quite cumbersome for testing multiple cases of a single function (I know that we&#39;re only required to test one case in this project, but I prefer to test more to make sure my code is correct). If I use a different formatting style -- that still has assert() calls for each of its cases -- is that okay?</p>

If i understand it correctly, we&#39;re in charge of making the add and mult fcn for accumulate fcn&#39;s multi functionality.  However, while accumulate should be tail recursive, can fcns add and mult simply be two integers being added/multiplied together? or do they have to be tail recursive as well? More specifically are they supposed to be the helper functions to accumulate?

<p>In one of the functions being implemented, I&#39;m calling a separate tail-recursive function in the return statement once it reaches the base case. Basically, I pass two changing lists tail-recursively, and when the base case comes up, the function returns append(first , second) to get the correct output. It never has to recoil the stack frames once it finishes appending the two lists, so would that still make the function tail-recursive? Or would I have to adjust it?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>I don&#39;t really get how to make this function tail recursive at all. The only way to iterate over a list is to use list_rest and get the first value, but once you&#39;ve called list_rest on a list, you remove an element you&#39;ll need later to put inside of the new reversed list. So I&#39;m a little confused. I&#39;ve thought about using a helper, I&#39;m not sure what to make it do since I can&#39;t really store numbers with it because for every step into the recursion, you lose information that was stored in the previous call of the recursive function. :\</p> <p></p> <p>Confused! :|</p>

<p>I am having trouble with the lab this week with the recursive functions for digit count. Instead of counting and outputting the count of how often a digit appears, my code outputs a 1 for each time the digit appears, and then outputs a sentence about recursion after. For the tail recursive function, I am holding the number of times the digit appears in a special variable I created in a helper function. When I step through my code I see the variable being counted correctly, but for some reason when the stack frames erase and it returns to the tail recursive function, it erases what was held and returns 0. I am not sure where I am going wrong in my code and would appreciated some help. I wasn&#39;t sure if I could post code on here, so for now I&#39;ll leave it at that explanation. Thanks.</p>

<p>I successfully implemented my filter_odd and filter_even functions, and am trying to do filter. I am using a helper function for this, and one of the parameters/arguments passed to the helper fxn is the function (fn). When I try to call the helper function by doing:</p> <p></p> <p><em>helper_function(parameter1, parameter2, fn(int value));</em></p> <p></p> <p>where int value is replaced by an updated value. I&#39;ve made sure that the value passed to fn is actually a valid int. But I still get an error message saying there is &#34;No matching function for call to [helper function].&#34; Am I missing something important on how to pass the bool function to the helper function? I believe it is that parameter that&#39;s causing an issue here....</p>

<p>My accumulate function works, but when testing it i realized that the base case returns identity. If identity is 0, the function will work if the function pointer is pointing to add because eventually it will add 0 and end. However, when testing the accumulate function with the pointer pointing to multiply, the answer is always 0 because the base case will eventually multiply by 0. if i change identity to 1, the multiply case works but when the pointer points to the add function the output will be the correct answer plus 1. Not sure how to find a way around this without specifying in my accumulate function whether add or multiply is being passed through.</p>

<p>Hi, I finished my tail recursion for countDigits both in the CAEN environment and the the labster and it runs perfectly. The only problem is that in the Labster, even if the function is tail-recursive, the memory display on the left still changes like the regular recursion, while the iteration re-use the storage of the stack frame. </p> <p></p> <p>Then I doubt if I was not writing a correct tail recursion. Then I tried to put the factorial tail recursion example in the lecture notes into Labster and then, it also runs like regular recursion without re-using the storage of the stack frame. Thus, I believe that there is some issues with the Labster whose memory display shows incorrectly.</p>

<p>This is what I understand so far. The functions sum and product will be used as fn in the accumulate function? I think that&#39;s what was said in lecture. What I don&#39;t understand is why the RME in the spec returns</p> <p></p> <pre>   fn(list_first(list), accumulate(list_rest(list), fn, identity))</pre> <p></p> <p>if sum and the product function&#39;s arguments data type is list_t, and, if I understand correctly, fn is just a placeholder for sum and product...which it probably isn&#39;t because the parameter are different. fn accepts two ints...so do we need to create helper functions?

<p>I finished my project several days ago, but came across a follow-up discussion &#64;452 on Piazza that made me question my solution to insert_list. </p> <p></p> <p>I wrote a function to determine the length of the list and performed the following operations on the list to insert:</p> <p></p> <pre>list_t insert_list(list_t first, list_t second, unsigned int n) { 	int firstLength = list_length(first, 0); 	first = rotate(first, n); 	first = append(first, second); 	first = rotate(first, firstLength - n); 	return first; }</pre> <p>This properly inserts second n spaces into first. All of the functions called are tail recursive.</p> <p></p> <p>However, according to the followup discussion I linked above, this solution is not considered tail recursive because the function itself is not recursive. To remedy this, I went ahead and essentially did the exact steps above but with a helper function instead of append.</p> <p></p> <p>The insert_list_helper function was identical to the append_helper, but on the return I rotated the created list to mimic the last operation in my above code. This seemed unnecessary to me, as I had already written this helper function for append. I was wondering if this solution was how I was expected to go about solving the problem - and I also wanted to bring up the fact that other students will most likely use my first approach since it only calls &#39;tail recursive&#39; functions.</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks.</p> <p></p>

<p>Hello! I&#39;ve spent a long while trying to get the traversal function to work properly.

Then the top most element is stored in the list successfully, the list is created properly on the way down the right side, but on the way up the right-side, the right-side elements are deleted from the list like they were on the left so that with any test case only the top most element is stored in the list.</p> <p></p> <p>Is this something I should bring to office hours rather than a private Piazza question?

<p>Is it still considered regular recursive if we use helper functions. I always thought that only tail recursive functions are only allowed to have helper functions?

<p>I am trying to write the traversal function and I can&#39;t think of a way to do this completely.

I would return 2 then and go right to 5. I would go all the way left from 5 and return 8. Return back to 5 , return 5, and go right to 9. Go left from 9 (which doesn&#39;t exist) -- since it doesn&#39;t exist I would return 9 and try to go right. Since that doesn&#39;t exist I would return back to 5. At this point, how would I get back to 2? I know I could return, but if the tree was longer down how would I do it?</p> <p>This is just one scenario that could go wrong in my method.

Since covered_by is a function that I wrote myself, it&#39;s not included in p2.h, meaning if I include covered_by only in p2.cpp and not in p2-tests.cpp, my test code cannot recognize covered_by. </p> <p></p> <p>Could the fact that my covered_by function is commented out in p2.cpp and placed in p2-tests.cpp be the reason that my files don&#39;t compile in the autograder?

If they do have a big difference, can you please explain to me the difference and the benefits of using pointers instead of passing by reference?</p>

<p>I&#39;m an avid euchre player, and know all of the rules. As I was reading through I noticed that you added an addition rule : &#34;In addition to being ordered by rank, cards are also ordered by suit: diamonds first, then clubs, hearts, and spades.&#34; In what situation does this even take place? I&#39;m assuming that trump is still the number one suit no matter what. Is this just incase different off-trump cards are played? For example, If a spades is lead and  the first 3 people play spades but the 4th player doesn&#39;t have a spade, and coincidentally plays a heart (assuming neither are trump), the player who plays the heart wins even though they technically wouldn&#39;t in the real euchre game?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>For adding/discarding, it says that the player will discard the lowest card.  I assume that if the player has 9, J, A in trump, and 10, Q out of trump, the player will discard the 10 (not trump) and not the 9 (trump).  Am I correct in assuming this?</p>

<p>I submitted my project to the autograder and Player_test00 had a compilation error.</p> <p></p> <p>I then tried compiling it in a caen environment and got this error message:<img src="https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/hyrdt7uykox4mt/hq42o0d7gyv3jh/i0wfvkgtnzpe/Screen_Shot_20141005_at_9.39.22_AM.png" width="458" height="161" /></p> <p>I made a helper function that removes a card by moving all of the cards after the unwanted card down one index to cover the unwanted card and then setting the last index to {}. I then update the size of the hand. Does anyone know what this error could mean and how I could fix it? Thanks!<br /><br />Edit: I think it&#39;s because I&#39;m not allowed to set a card = {}. How do we actually get rid of the card? Do we not really have to because since we update the size of the hand it&#39;s as if there isn&#39;t really a card there anyway?<br /><br />Also, strictly for the checkpoint-submission, if we pass all three tests do we get full credit for the checkpoint or are there further tests we don&#39;t see?</p>

<TEXT>
For the Player_Play Card function,  I am getting a segmentation fault.    I am first checking to see if the Card has the same suit as the suit of the led card.  Then, I am using Card_compare(&amp;cardCheck,&amp;(player_ptr-&gt;hand[i]),trump) if the suit is not the same.  I just don&#39;t understand the spec: &#34;If a player can follow suit, he can play the highest card that follows suit.  Otherwise, he plays the lowest card in his hand.  We did 3 compare functions which all determine different orderings, so which one should we use?

<p>In the add_and_discard function, assuming we are able to identify which card to add and which card to discard, is there an expectation as to where we add the card? For example, do we have to add it at the beginning (or end) only and leave the rest of the cards (minus the discarded card) in the same order as before? Or can we simply replace the discarded card with the added card (i.e. overwriting that element of the player.hand array)?</p> <p></p> <p>To my knowledge, the spec doesn&#39;t seem to specify this, or whether it matters one way or the other.</p>

<p>The spec describes the strategy for playing as follows: <br /><br />&#34;If a player can follow suit, he plays the highest card that follows suit.

<p>If the upcard is a 10 of hearts, but the dealer is being forced to add it to their hand due to the screw the dealer rule, then the trump suit will have been set to diamonds.

<p>From lecture, we decided that we don&#39;t need to modify anything in Flatland.cpp...</p> <p></p> <p>My question though is, haven&#39;t we changed the way to construct a triangle? So when you make a triangle, your third argument has to be an angle in radians and not a side?</p> <p></p> <p>I understand how we can convert the angle to a side c to use within Triangle.cpp using some trig, but my question is why Triangle(a,b,c) still works if the constructor is Triangle(a,b,angle) when using the triangle constructor in Flatland.cpp.</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks!</p>

<p>When I make my .tar file to submit for the checkpoint it properly assembles all of the required files (including Card.cpp) however upon submission to the autograder, the autograder feedback returns that Card.cpp is missing and a submission has not been charged.  I went back and opened up the .tar file to make sure Card.cpp was there and it was.  I&#39;ve also ensured that the file name is correct with no extra characters etc.</p> <p>Also, based on the way Make works, it wouldn&#39;t successfully build the right target file without Card.cpp being there in the first place.</p> <p>Ideas?</p> <p>ED: figured it out</p>

<p>I wrote Pack.cpp and ran it both using Visual Studio and the Linux terminal (with g&#43;&#43;). In both cases, the published test cases (in Pack_tests.cpp) run without error.

<p>For the autograder checkpoint, in the spec, it says we only need to pass the &#34;published unit tests.&#34; Does this mean we need to pass only the unit tests given to us in the test cases files, or some other unknown test cases that the autograder runs?</p> <p></p> <p>I guess what it boils down to is, which functions within Card.cpp, Pack.cpp, and Player.cpp need to be finished and working properly?

So I&#39;m trying to find the bug in my code that makes my player.cpp fail the autograder.  The spec says:  &#34;Each other hand must follow the led suit, if able, and otherwise may play any card.&#34;  Does this mean if player 1 leads a card, player 2 doesnt have to follow the led suit but player 3 does?  Why would the spec say &#34;otherwise may play any card&#34;?

<p>For the last two functions in Player.cpp, the person leads/plays a card depending on predetermined strategy, but I&#39;m confused as to what constitutes actually removing the card from the array.

However, I don&#39;t understand how to &#34;remove&#34; the lingering element from the hand[] array. I tried setting it equal to NULL, which didn&#39;t work, and I currently am assigning to it an initialized card with undefined rank and suit. Is this acceptable, or am I missing something?</p>

<p>I&#39;m running into a very strange, consistent error when trying to test Player_lead_card. The function seems to, in some way, add a space and an end-of-transmission character(ASCII value 0004) to the name of the player passed to the function. This causes the <tt>strcmp(alice.name, &#34;Alice&#34;) = 0 </tt>assert at the beginning of Player_tests.cpp to evaluate to false, exiting the test program. I&#39;ve rewritten the function 3 times with completely different structures in an attempt to figure out what&#39;s accessing alice.name that shouldn&#39;t be, but I&#39;ve had no luck so far. Nothing seems to be going off the end of its respective array or anything like that, so I&#39;m stumped. Has anyone else had a similar problem with this function?</p> <p></p> <p>Update: omitting the -O1 flag from the command when compiling Player_tests solves the problem. Does the autograder use this flag? How can I fix this to work with O1?</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks</p> <p></p>

<p>Quick question on Pack_init. I am using getline to get the suit and rank for each card and then have been splitting them into separate char with strtok. I have also been using x as a counter so I can traverse the Cards array within the pointer struct.</p> <p></p> <p>When I go to implement Card_init(pack_ptr-&gt;cards[x], rank, suit) (suit and rank are the split char). I get this error: error C2665: &#39;Card_init&#39; : none of the 2 overloads could convert all the argument types.</p> <p></p> <p>I think I&#39;m calling the pack_ptr wrong, but I don&#39;t know how to fix it.

<p>I am having a very odd problem with shuffle. The function pretty much works, all the cards are in the right order. The first card is correct, however the only incorrect card is the last card. It should be Jack of Spades, but it is an out of order Nine of Spades. I am printing out the cards so I can error check, and somehow, my function has created another Nine of Spades in place of the Jack of Spades. Any possible explanations for this?</p>

<p>I get the pack to read from pack.in and initialise all the cards in the pack properly on Windows, but when I compile in Linux the entire pack gets initialised to &#34;Two of Spades&#34;.  I&#39;m assuming this is a read-from-file quirk of Linux that makes it treat pack.in differently than in Windows.  Does anyone have any suggestions/fixes to this?</p> <p></p> <p>...Either a read-from-file quirk, or a string quirk with Card_init.  I have double-checked, and I am <strong>not</strong> comparing memory locations of the char* strings being passed to Card_init.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a little unclear how play works between hands.  I <em>think</em> the way it works is that, within a hand, each player loses one of their cards, until everyone has zero cards; at this point, the majority of the cards have been discarded and there are only a couple remaining.  What happens next?  Does the pack get reset?  If shuffle was off at the beginning of the game, do we shuffle between hands?  (If we don&#39;t shuffle between hands, we&#39;ll just keep getting the same result over and over... unless, possibly, we&#39;re supposed to shift the remaining cards to the beginning and add in the discarded cards to the end.)  At the beginning of each hand, we go through one or two rounds of making.  Is this correct?</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I&#39;m finishing up the final player published test case, but I&#39;m confused.  It asserts that the card played isn&#39;t the queen of spades.  But isn&#39;t that the card the player should be playing, given that the queen of spades is his mincard since spades is the trump?</p>

<p>When I went to OHs before, the GSI told me to copy and paste the direct address of my pack.in file into the function call of Pack_init since the file was not opening without it. Obviously, the published test cases do not have this address specification, so when I run the published test cases to pack I cannot open pack.in. Another GSI said to #include &lt;cstdlib&gt; but it is still not opening for me. I included &lt;cstdlib&gt; in both pack.cpp and pack_tests.cpp just to be sure...</p>

<p>I have compiled my code in Xcode and in Linux and it works in both.

Why do I keep getting a compilation error?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if anyone noticed this, but the shuffle function that swaps the first 17 cards with the last 7 cards in a deck 3 times does the same operation as swapping the first 3 cards with the last 21 cards. 7*3 = 21 &lt; 24, so no weird things happen with the cards. Will it be acceptable if one were to change the shuffle function to swapping the first 3 cards with the last 21 cards since this is logically equivalent to the required shuffle?</p>

<p>Okay, so I wrote my player.cpp, and passed published tests. Unfortunately on auto-grader it did not compile, and no matter how much I looked I did not see a problem.

<p>why we need to use cstring for most parts of the program? For me, it seems better to use c&#43;&#43; string</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>Hi all,</p> <p></p> <p>So I understand that technically, under the hood, a C-string is a pointer that</p> <p></p> <p>by default is pointing to the first character in an array of chars,</p> <p></p> <p>but then if we wanted to access the other chars in this array of chars, we are able to traverse this array</p> <p></p> <p>Which we could do by adding 1, 2, 3, etc. (up to the length of this array) to the value of the C-string pointer</p> <p></p> <p>Because then we are just modifying the memory address that this C-string points to.</p> <p></p> <p>Hoping that these above points are correct, my question is then this:</p> <p></p> <p>If C-strings are technically, datatype-wise, pointers to an array of chars, are all arrays technically pointers that point to to little slices of memory holding some group of values that are &#34;in a row?&#34;</p> <p></p> <p>ex: There is an array of integers called numArr holding {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} . Is numArr the pointer datatype? Does it then point to the memory address holding the int 1 by default?</p> <p></p> <p>Thank you in advance for clarifyng this point!

<p>This is a very specific question. Using lecture 9, slides 19-20 as an example: you have several instances of a struct in an array and these structs contain data. The data can be accessed how they are in the slides:</p> <pre>triangles[0].a=3;<br />triangles[1].b=12;<br />triangles[2].c=17;</pre> <p>It was also mentioned in the lecture that a,b, and c of each triangle are next to each other in memory. Therefore, would it be possible to access this data with code like:</p> <pre>triangles[0][0]=3;<br />triangles[1][1]=12;<br />triangles[2][2]=17;</pre> <p>In other words, would going off the array still be accessing significant data, in this case... or am I just oversimplifying how memory works?<br /><br />Thanks!</p>

<p>Just going through some of the slides and I have a question about pointers like such &#34;TYPE* cons p&#34;. It says that the pointer cannot be changed, does this mean that the address that the pointer points to cannot be changed?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>When dealing with pointers, &#34; *pointer = var&#34; means that the value of pointer is the value of var. Also, if I did &#34;pointer = &amp;var&#34; means that the value of pointer would be the address of var?</p>

<p>I attended the review session and so I have the answers to the Winter and Spring midterm Exams.</p> <p>While reviewing, I am looking at Problem 3 in the Winter 2014 Midterm exam: C-strings. To find the starting point makes sense: call find_key(doc, &#34;&lt;img&#34;) which use the c-string of doc and returns a pointer to the &#34;&lt;&#34; needed. He set this equal to const char *a. I noticed to find the last char in the img, Vidal called find_key again in the notion of &#34;const char *b = find_key(a, &#34;&gt;&#34;). This doesn&#39;t make sense to me, because in this case, &#34;a&#34; is a pointer to only the first element of the string..</p> <p>is this a legit thing to do because a points in the string and knows everything else that resides past it?

<p>For problem 4 on Spring Midterm Exam, function insert:<br />Vidal did this problem by taking every char starting at spot and moving it strlen(to_insert) spots down. This works as long as the length of to-insert plus the point that spot is pointing to is already empty. Can this be assumed? If not, what if the string was &#34;spamming&#34; and to-insert was AAA and the spot was &#34;a&#34; in spamming? Then he would start moving &#34;a&#34; down 3 spots and it would replace the &#34;i&#34; in spamming which would never be able to be seen again and thus could not be copied later on.</p>

The first element in d, which is 4, is now the first element in c. A.K.A, copied over.  <ul><li>So now array &#34;a&#34; is {4, 2, 3} and array &#34;b&#34; is {4, 5, 8}. </li></ul> </li><li>*c<strong>&#43;&#43; = </strong>*d<strong>&#43;&#43; </strong>is executed. Now, the index of c and d are both at the second element (i.e. a [ 1 ] and b [ 1 ]). <ul><li>Array &#34;a&#34; is {4, 2, 3} and array &#34;b&#34; is {4, 5, 8}</li></ul> </li></ul> <p></p> <p>In the second command:</p> <ul><li> <strong>*c = (*d)</strong>&#43;&#43; is executed first. Now, the second element in d is now the second element in c. A.K.A, copied over.  <ul><li>Array &#34;a&#34; is {4, 5, 3} and array &#34;b&#34; is {4, 5, 8}.</li></ul> </li><li>*c = (*d)<strong>&#43;&#43; </strong>is executed. Now, the value at the second element in b is incremented by one (i.e. a [ 1 ] = 6). <ul><li>So finally, array &#34;a&#34; is {4, 5, 3} and array &#34;b&#34; is {4, 6, 8}. </li></ul> </li></ul> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Someone please comment on whether my process is write or wrong. And/or what process I need to fix/understand. </p> <p>Also, when I say &#34;first element in d&#34;, I mean &#34;d&#34; that points to b. Just wanted to clarify that. </p> <p></p> <p>Thanks for the help!</p> <p></p>

<p>So below is an image of on of the lecture slides from the Structs and Classes Lecture. This is at minute 37:00 in the Blue Review recording. I saw here that<br />&amp;w is passed into poke, and poke has the parameter (const X* z).<br />The way that I understood this is that<br />-  The parameter requires that z is a pointer to a constant X   (X being the struct that was previously declared), and that</p> <p></p> <p>-   w is an X, but not a const X.</p> <p></p> <p>-  &amp;w is the memory address of an X, but it is <em>not </em>the memory address of a const X .</p> <p></p> <p>My question is this: If &amp;w is <em>not </em>the memory address of a <em>const </em>X, then why is still allowed to be passed in for a pointer that points to a <em>const </em>X ??<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><img src="https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/hyrdt7uykox4mt/gx0gjpc96re3fh/i1a5ne8gbluh/Screen_Shot_20141015_at_12.03.03_AM.png" /></p>

<p>For this question, older is supposed to take on the elements of newer and exclude the last element because older-&gt;num_fruits actually updates to 4, right? But with the code I have, the last element is still printing, and older isn&#39;t even taking on the values of newer. Is the following code correct and I&#39;m just thinking about it wrong? Or is something wrong with the code that is causing the wrong input? </p> <p></p> <pre>void new_update(Basket* older, Basket* newer, Consume fn, string eat) { 	older = newer; 	older-&gt;num_fruits = fn(older-&gt;fruits, older-&gt;num_fruits, eat); }</pre> <p></p>

<p>If asked to use traversal by pointer, is it illegal to use anything with the format *(ptr &#43; i) for any reason, or would one be allowed to use such a statement outside the body of the loop which governed the traversal. For instance, for something like problem 2b in the spring midterm (assuming that problem specified that you were to use traversal by pointer), would it be legal to use a statement like *(fruits &#43; num_fruits) = *i within the loop for (string* i = fruits; i &lt; fruits &#43; num_fruits; i&#43;&#43;)</p>

<p>Can anybody explain all of the *(&#43;&#43;ptr), *(ptr&#43;&#43;), etc.?</p> <p></p> <p>What are the differences in the two above (and maybe more) similar statements?</p> <p>I know roughly what they do, but what would be a very concise, clear explanation of what they do?</p>

<TEXT>
For the array a, I have two different responses 3 2 3 and 1 3 3 The former: Pointers are pass by value, thus any changes to where b is pointing to when passed through helper shouldn&#39;t reflect any changes to where it points to in main.   The latter: I simply follow the operations of helper when it&#39;s called.

<p>For question 2d in Spring, we have to update older so its fruits array is the same as newer&#39;s by using pointer traversal or loop. Should I assume that both basket-&gt;num_fruits has the same value?</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Having trouble with f4. f3 (--*p) returns 15 14 13 12 11 10 (I think) because it takes the pointer value starting at the 16 spot and ending at the 11 spot and then returns the value minus 1.  f4 couts (*p)-- and i&#39;m not sure what that means.

So as I was looking over my code from before checkpoint 3, I realized that I probably should not be using Card_get_suit() in Player_make_trump() because trump has not been made yet. My question is should I be using Card_get_suit() and make the upcard-&gt;suit as the trump parameter or just use upcard-&gt;suit to compare the suits?  The reason why I ask is because Professor DeOrio was mentioning at office hours how there are two functions in which we cannot use Card_get_suit() but I forgot which. Any ideas?

This is done because when I make the players play cards, the card played by player 0 is a  Two of Spades which is a bug.  EDIT: Nvm, I am pass the issue.  Therefore, I don&#39;t need to print out the card.

<TEXT>
<p>Can I assume that an initlialized card/non empty card is always passed to Player_add_input? Also, does it matter if I add new cards to the front or back of hand?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>I&#39;m assuming we should call Pack_deal_one in our function that deals cards to the players in the 3-2-3-2, 2-3-2-3 fashion described in the specs. Even though the Pack_deal_one fxn. increments the next pointer, how is it okay that it keeps the dealt card in the pack? If we are to call this function to deal cards, don&#39;t we also need to discard the dealt card from the pack? Do we then need to write our own function to discard cards from pack?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>I see we have a command to run diff with the correct output and our own &#34;make test.&#34;</p> <p></p> <p>It also says to add more. My question is where should those be added? Should we make a Game_tests.cpp or euchre_tests.cpp file? And can I edit the Makefile to add those tests to make?</p> <p></p> <p>The reason is I want to test my Game_init function. (Running the entire test is not helpful now because I&#39;m not completely done.)</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I was wondering are there any good software to use that lets us code together with other people we know (eecs280 partner). Sometimes during the week we can&#39;t meet so I think a better way is to use a software that lets use share code and code together. I was told about Github but I heard it displays all of our code publicly which seems dangerous to do. If we are not allowed to use Github, are there any other ways?</p>

For my Game.cpp and euchre.cpp, my code compiles and executes properly in linux.  However, in the autograder, I got compilation errors for the euchretest0 and euchretest1 test cases.  What could be  causing this?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
To ensure I&#39;m not going crazy &#34;In addition to being ordered by rank, cards are also ordered by suit: diamonds first, then clubs, hearts, and spades.&#34; This means that if trump was clubs, and the cards being compared was a 9 of spades and 9 of diamonds, the 9 of spades would be &#34;larger&#34;?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>When the dealer is reached in the second round of making trump, what should we output?</p> <p></p> <p>If the dealer&#39;s cards imply that he should pass, should we say he passes and just envoke screw the dealer, or just say that he ordered up no matter what his cards are.</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>If both occur we print &#34;march!&#34; first and then &#34;euchre!&#34;. Yes?</p>

<p>When I submit to the autograder, I pass all the tests except for the last one. I keep getting &#34;Compilation error!&#34; for Player_tests.</p> <p></p> <p>I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s wrong. Everything compiles and passes on the CAEN linux machine I&#39;m using. Just to be extra safe, I&#39;ve redownloaded the exact files that the autograder checks by downloading the submission_file from my email. Then, I extract the files directly into the download folder. While still in my downloads folder of the CAEN computer and without altering the files in any way, I run the following command:</p> <p></p> <p>g&#43;&#43; -pedantic -Wall -Werror -O1 Pack_tests.cpp Pack.cpp Card.cpp -o Pack_tests</p> <p></p> <p>...and everything compiles perfectly. The autograder compiler must be different from the compilers of the CAEN machines in some way.

<p>So the specifications state:</p> <p>1) &#34;The complete ordering of all the cards is [all trump cards (including left bower)]].  The aces of the remaining three suits follow in suit order, the remaining kings in suit order, ..., and finally the remaining nines in suit order.&#34;</p> <p>2) &#34;If a player can follow suit, he plays the highest card that follows suit.  Otherwise, he plays the lowest card in his hand.&#34;</p> <p></p> <p>The first trick in euchre_test01.out.correct does not appear to follow this rule?  The file reads:</p> <p></p> <p>Hand 0<br />Alice deals<br />Ace of Diamonds turned up<br />Bob passes<br />Cathy passes<br />Drew passes<br />Alice orders up Diamonds</p> <p>Ace of Spades led by Bob<br />Nine of Hearts played by Cathy<br />Queen of Hearts played by Drew<br /><strong>Ace of Hearts played by Alice</strong><br />Bob takes the trick</p> <p></p> <p>Why does Alice play the ace of hearts and not the nine of clubs?  She doesn&#39;t have any cards that follow suit (spades), and aces are supposed to be higher than nines, regardless of suit order.  Moreover, neither the ace of hearts nor the nine of clubs is a trump card, so they should be compared solely based on rank...  According to the cards I have shuffled by hand and dealt according to the specifications, Alice has the ace of hearts, nine of clubs, and jack-queen-king of diamonds.  Given that everyone else&#39;s cards played in the euchre_test00.out.correct file matched my output and my output has matched this out.correct file up until this point, I am fairly confident this is a card_compare issue, but I don&#39;t know why my solution is incorrect.</p>

<p>I&#39;m failing both on local Linux and in the autograder.  I&#39;m wondering if this is because the euchre_test00.out.correct file has the command line arguments at the top and my .out files do not, or if something else is going on.  When I open up my .out files and run the text against the text in the .out.correct files on diffchecker.com, I get the message that the two files are identical (I&#39;m not including the command line arguments when I copy the .out.correct files on diffchecker.com).  Are we supposed to remove the top line on the .out.correct files before using the makefile test?</p> <p></p> <p>Orrrrr am I maybe failing the autograder because my final-submit tar doesn&#39;t have any .out / .out.correct files?</p>

<p>So I made a helper function to shuffle(or not shuffle) and then deal out the cards to each player. What is the best way to go about this?

So, i just used the Player_deal_one function, but this means i have to manually set my hand_size to 5…is this okay? We can assume the hand size will always be 5 for every player,right?</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks</p>

<p>In trying to write Game_make_trump, I noticed that the Player_make_trump function wasn&#39;t recognizing if it was the dealer or not (to invoke screw the dealer).

I then changed it to</p> <p></p> <p>if(player_ptr == dealer)  {...}</p> <p></p> <p>which should come out equal since both addresses are the same, as shown by my cout message:</p> <p></p> <p>player ptr: 0x8fffb6a575b8</p> <p>dealer: 0x8fffb6a575b8</p> <p></p> <p>However, when I run the program, it hits a segmentation fault at this point.

Like do we only assign all of the parameters and scores to 0? or do we deal cards? do we make trump? How far into the game does the game have to be initialized? The RME seems to be vague.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>When I run the make Game command in the terminal, it tells me that none of the functions from any other files are defined, but my game.cpp file includes the game.h file which includes the other files necessary.</p> <p>Why are these error messages appearing?</p> <p><img src="https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/hyrdt7uykox4mt/hpju5ye5ts86jp/i1p5krub3ri2/Screen_Shot_20141025_at_11.58.51_AM.png" /></p>

<p>Just wondering, can we create separate functions to test each game function within player_tests, pack_tests, etc.? There&#39;s no int main statement in any of those files so that&#39;s why I&#39;m wondering.

<p>Just wanted to clarify everything that is due for the final submission.</p> <p>1. Card cpp and card test</p> <p>2. pack cpp and pack tests</p> <p>3. player cpp and player tests</p> <p>4. game cpp</p> <p>5. euchre cpp</p> <p>6 group.txt</p> <p></p> <p>Also, regarding test cases do we need to write test cases for the game/euchre component or only for card, pack, and player? As for card, pack, and player we were given test cases, so do we need to write more, and if so how many more? I think I remember hearing that we need to write at least one more for each function (in card, pack, and player), is this correct?</p> <p>What about for functions we created to help us with the actual game part?</p> <p></p> <p>Finally, on functions that we wrote that have a requires clause do we need to use assert to check that the user follows the requires clause or is this not necessary?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>I ask this in regards to Player_tests.cpp, Pack_tests.cpp, and Card_tests.cpp.</p> <p></p> <p>I assume we do not have to submit test cases for Game.cpp and euchre.cpp, (although it&#39;s obviously a good idea to develop them on our own). Is this assumption correct?</p>

<p>When testing our output vs the sample output, the same card is flipped over and bob, cathy, and drew are all dealt the correct 5 cards. But somehow Alice is not being dealt the correct hand..

<p>I was wondering for this test case of Player_playe_card if the trump suit was Diamonds and the led_card was suit diamonds and Drew had: Jack of Hearts, Jack of Diamonds, and Ten of Diamonds. What does he play? Can you explain why please?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>I&#39;m assuming that this function will only be used whenever a player orders up at the beginning of each hand. If that&#39;s right, is this function only supposed to do simple comparisons between cards? Or do we need to take the suit of the upcard in consideration as well?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit confused at what is supposed to happen at the end of a hand. The pack gets reset I&#39;m sure but is it supposed to always reshuffle the deck or does it just depend on whether the argument passed in is &#34;shuffle&#34; or &#34;noshuffle&#34;?</p>

<p> I&#39;m using the pack_deal_one function and assigning it to a card, and then am printing out the card and am getting a segmentation fault when I use card print but its not always occuring. I&#39;m calling pack_deal_one and then card print numerous times and most of them work fine and print the card but occasionally the seg fault occurs and I can&#39;t figure out why this is.</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>This may sound very dumb (and even incomprehensible) so bear with me. </p> <p></p> <p>I&#39;ll come up with a quick scenario. If player[2] is dealing, that means the first 3 cards are dealt to player[1], then 2 cards to player[0], and then 3 cards to player[3].</p> <p></p> <p>If player[2] is leading, that means he plays a card, then player[3] plays next, and then player[0] plays next.</p> <p></p> <p>Okay, so you get my drift. Initially, I thought everything would have been easy if we just looped the dealing and playing cards. But then I came across the problem of transitioning from 3 to 0 (and vice versa). Any advice in general on how we could think this through? Anything better than looping? Do I actually have to create 4 different if statements on how everything is dealt?</p>

I&#39;m running into a segmentation fault in Game_play.  Debugging revealed that the problem lied in my helper fcn, Game_shuffle.  I simply entered in &#39;noshuffle&#39; to leave it out, ran it, and it worked. Ergo it works with an unshuffled deck.  So I&#34;m a little confused that while my pack_shuffle fcn works and passes tests, my game_shuffle helper fcn results in a segmentation fault when I implement it.  Note I threw in a Card_print in Game_play.  gdb printed out &#34;Cannot access memory at address 0x8003f5a00&#34;.  However Card_print was successful in printing cards w/unshuffled deck.   Apologies for the lengthy post.

In the spec, it says &#34;Eldest hand (player at left of the dealer, e.g., player 3 is left of player 2, and player 0 is left of player 3)&#34;  Thus, the first command, which has Alice, Bob, Cathy, and Drew means P0: Alice  P3: Bob  P2: Cathy  P1 Drew?  If so the order of players[i] doesn&#39;t make for a nice for loop so should I do some sort of rearrange/reinit of the players&#39; indexing?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>1). If we have to shuffle the deck, do we shuffle before we deal the first hand or do we deal the hand with the deck as is<br />2). is the player who leads card always the player left of dealer<br />3). will the upcard be the last card in the deck</p>

<p>So I&#39;m running the diff command to check the outputs and I get this as my output</p> <p></p> <p>26c26<br />&lt; Queen of Clubs played by Drew<br />---<br />&gt; Queen of Clubs played by Drew </p> <p></p> <p>I also tried adding the -q as sugguested on another post but that just tells me my files differ.</p> <p>I also checked for extra spaces, so that&#39;s not the issue.

<p>On page 4 of the spec we are given an example. Once cards are dealt, Alice will hold the cards: Jack of Hearts, Queen of Hearts, Ace of Clubs, Nine of Diamonds and Ten of Diamonds. If the upcard is Jack of Diamonds, in round one after everyone passes, shouldn&#39;t Alice be the one to order up? According to the spec, Alice also passes though. Why is this?</p>

<p>Not sure if I&#39;m going crazy or not, but here&#39;s what happened:</p> <p></p> <p>Yesterday I found a bug in my code involving a nine of spades in index 4 of the player&#39;s hand. Somehow it was duplicating the card or something, not exactly sure.</p> <p></p> <p>Anyways, I found it yesterday and just today I was looking at my code to try and fix it...but I think it&#39;s not a problem anymore?</p> <p></p> <p>Which has me really worried because does this mean it&#39;s a bug that only shows up some of the time?!</p> <p>I gave it the exact same inputs as yesterday and it looks like it&#39;s no longer an issue. What does this mean?</p> <p>---------</p> <p>Also a few days ago I was trying to print out a card and it printed out as &#34;Spades of Spades.&#34; Running it again later, it was corrected to &#34;Nine of Spades&#34; and I haven&#39;t had the problem again. This issue is weird because the Card_print function was given to us.</p>

Also, if the test cases we wrote for Card.cpp, Pack.cpp, and Player.cpp passed the checkpoint tests, does that mean we don&#39;t need to make any changes to them or add any additional test cases?</p>

<p>When my partner and I test the whole project, we get identical output to euchre_test01 and euchre_test00, but are still failing it in the autograder. We have used q flags in diff and have used valgrind, both of which come up with no errors. The outputs are identical. A professor said that the autograder tests euchre_test00 and euchre_test01, the tests that we keep failing, are only testing for the output that we have in the text files we were given. What could be the problem?</p>

<p>Quick questions for getting shuffle and player names from the arguments to main.</p> <p></p> <p>For shuffle, I want to make a bool true if the argument is equal to &#34;shuffle&#34; and false otherwise. Would this be the correct way to do this:</p> <p></p> <p>if (strcmp(argv[2], &#34;shuffle&#34;) == 0)<br />    {<br />        bool shuffle = true;<br />    }<br />    else<br />    {<br />        bool shuffle = false;<br />    }</p> <p></p> <p>Because I&#39;m getting an error that says shuffle is unused which makes me think the function never gets into the if statement.</p> <p></p> <p>Also, for creating an array of player names from the arguments, I tried doing this:</p> <p></p> <p>const char *const player_names[4];<br />    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i&#43;&#43;)<br />    {<br />        player_names[i] = argv[i&#43;4];<br />    }</p> <p></p> <p>and got an error saying i can&#39;t change a read-only location (player_names). How can I make an array and add names to it that has to be constant when it&#39;s passed to Game_init?</p>

<p>Hi, I have been looking at my code for over an hour now and upon playing the second hand, the player&#39;s number of cards does not decrease and they still have the same number and type of cards.  It is not my function for Player_play_card as it passed my tests and the published test cases for Player.cpp.  I am pretty sure it has to do with how I am arranging the players.  I put the 4 players in a 2-star array and arranged that array depending on who is the dealer and/or who took the trick, when appropriate.<br /><br />My code in the game portion is like this:<br />Player_play_card(deal_order_array[3], &amp;led_card, trump_suit)<br /><br />My code in the player_tests portion is like this:<br />Player_play_card(&amp;PlayerOne, &amp;nine_hearts, SPADES);<br /><br />So in the game portion, it is taking in a pointer to a Player instead of a pointer to the address of a Player.  I want to get the memory address of the player its pointing to.  Is that possible?  I tried &#34;&amp;&amp;&#34; which was incorrect and googled around to find the answer with no luck.  We didn&#39;t really discuss two-star pointers in the lecture that I can recall either.  Am I just really going in the wrong direction with this?  Please let me know.  I would really appreciate the assistance.  Thank you.</p>

<p>Do we need to account for players having the same names? Like will there be a case with two people named Alice, or can we assume that all names will be unique? </p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>So I get that strcpy is supposed to be used to put the names from the command line into player_names. However, to do this, the elements of player_names must have a large enough size to contain the names. Would it be ok to accomplish this by going through each element of player names and saying</p> <p></p> <p>player_names[i] = new char [MAX_STR_LEN];</p> <p></p> <p>Or would that count as using dynamic memory and therefore not be good style for this project? If so, how else can you make sure the arrays in player_names are large enough to contain the names?</p>

<p>Hey guys,</p> <p>I had about 37 errors show up on valgrind. Turns out their documentation recommends turning off any optimization flags (such as -O1 that we use) as they can throw up a lot of false negatives. In my case, after turning off the opt flag my errors were down to just four: including a segfault. The segfault wasn&#39;t showing up when I ran ./euchre in terminal (turns out valgrind runs the program in a different environment).</p> <p></p> <p>Good luck</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m missing something really obvious, but I can&#39;t figure out why I&#39;m getting a segfault.</p> <p></p> <p>I&#39;m pretty sure the code that is causing the segfault is the following code in game_play.</p> <p>Pack pack2 = game_ptr-&gt;pack;<br /> Card first_card = Pack_deal_one(&amp;pack2);<br /> Card_print(&amp;first_card);</p> <p></p> <p>I know this is a problem in game_play because running the same code in game_init does not cause any problems. I suppose it has something to do with the fact that game_ptr is initialized in game_init, while it is passed to game_play, but I have no idea how that causes the code to behave differently in game_play.</p>

Seg faults were pretty much the bane of my (and I&#39;m sure the TA&#39;s) existence.  That being said, poor time management left me unable to practice test-driven development, and it seems like that could&#39;ve really helped to avoid a lot of those seg faults.  For Project 4, I&#39;m going to really try to get a start in adopting test-driven development but are there any tips out there to avoid these critters?  Do ADT&#39;s welcome some new kind of common error?

Code compiles for Task 1, however the Area for the circle is 0, and there is only one hashtag where the circle should be.  Thoughts? I thought I had added the scope operator followed by Ellipse at the appropriate spots but perhaps it&#39;s a different issue? I&#39;m also including the ellipse constructor when initializing the circle, and made the fcn type for area and draw of type Circle.

<p>Yes, I am going to write test cases first!</p> <p></p> <p>I will also heed the advice to split them into multiple files, and they must at least consist of a main function.</p> <p></p> <p><strong>My questions are</strong>: So within this main function, would we be creating possibly false representation invariants or something and asserting that our code fails appropriately? Or are we creating test cases to specifically highlight /correct/ ADT implementations? (Or both?)</p> <p></p> <p>I&#39;d imagine that there would be different ways to represent a player (because we have several &#34;is a&#34; relationships), and some of those ways would be correct and some incorrect. So should our tests should be testing for both good and bad ADT implementations/representation invariants?</p>

<p>1. In the implementation of Deck&#39;s member function deal(), there&#39;s an issue of &#34;going off&#34; the end of the cards[] array. In deal(), even though the requires clause states that the deck cannot be empty (so the function will always return a valid card), what happens when I return the last card in the array at index 51? With a &#34;newly opened&#34; deck, if I&#39;ve dealt all the previous 51 cards and I call deal() once more, the Card returned would be the Ace of Diamonds. However, the *next pointer would then have to increment one past cards[51], which is not a valid address in the array. How should I handle this? Is it okay to leave it be, considering that the requires clause enforces the *next pointer actually pointing to a valid index in the cards[] array and so deal() would never be called in this situation?</p> <p> </p> <p>2. Deck&#39;s member function cards_remaining() has a similar issue. In order to return the correct number of cards, I must add 52 to cards (where cards is just the pointer to the first element in the array). However, adding 52 would give an address that is one past the end of the array. Is this okay, considering that my implementation returns the correct number anyway?</p> <p> </p> <p>3. How are we to determine, for every situtation, which value -- 1 or 11 -- of the ace is more advantageous for the player? I realize that if the player&#39;s hand value is 10 and an ace is recieved, then it should take the value of 11; and if the hand value is greater than 10, then 1 should be chosen. But what of hand values less than 10? And what about if they are dealt two aces? Should one ace be 11 and the other be 1, or both of them are 1? A problem am I having is that Hand does not keep track of which cards are in the hand, only the total value. How can we decide which value of the ace is more advantageous if we do not know what future cards will be dealt?</p> <p> </p> <p>As an illustration of this, let&#39;s say the player is dealt a 7 and an ace. Then the player&#39;s hand value could be either 18 or 8. Which value the ace takes depends on future cards -- if the player receives a King, then the ace taking the value of 1 would clearly be more advantageous; but if the player received a 3, then the ace should take the value of 11. But Hand does not keep track of individual cards, only the total! If the ace is received, then we must decide the value of the ace then and there. How can we decide if it would be better for it to be 1 or 11?</p>

<p>So I am running into an issue when trying to #include needed files in my player_tests. I started off by only including the .h files. this became an issues because there were no abstractions for my derived classes in the Player.h file, so my tests didn&#39;t know that the derived classes I had written existed. So I then tried to #include the Player.cpp file, so that my tests could see those derived classes, but then the compiler whined to me about a redeclaration of the player_factory function because it has a prototype in the .h file as well as an implementation in the .cpp file. So now I am stuck between a rock and a hard place with the only seemingly way out of it to be to add abstractions in the .h file for my derived classes, but the spec clearly states not changing the .h files so... I am stuck...</p>

<p>Reading through the spec, I noticed the bit about not having any interdependent relationships between implementation files. Does this only apply to adding some sort of helper functions?

<p>A little confused about the class hand - in the member functions, the RME&#39;s describe that they add/discard cards to the hand.  Since the the class hand contains only the member variables, value and soft, do the RME&#39;s actually mean adding/discarding value?  Getting a little mixed up with the Euchre project, thanks!</p>

<p>In the spec, it says,</p> <p>&#34;You must also declare a static global instance of each of the three Players in Player.cpp .

Good Evening. This is my second time taking the course.  I dropped it prior to submitting Project 3.  I am also aware of the partner policy, and how we&#39;re unable to work with someone who&#39;s taking the course for the first time. However, I was wondering if this rule still applied for Project 4, since it&#39;s past the time in which I dropped the course?  Thank you very much.

<p>I was thinking this morning at how after we submit our projects to the final autograder that that&#39;s the rest that we do with the project.</p> <p></p> <p>I thought that maybe a good idea of what the staff could do to foster a better learning experience would be for the final autograder, and only the final autograder, we could receive the input and/or the output our program put out compared to the correct output. Giving this to students would allow them to reflect on what went wrong in their program and why/how.</p> <p></p> <p>Another thing this could really help with is the idea of implement, test, re-implement/improve. Given a certain period of time after we were given the final results from the autograder we could fix our programs and resubmit them for additional credit with only regards to the autograder score and not style. This would cause students to have to re-look at their programs and to also have left sufficient comments for themselves so that they would be able to once again easily pickup the project again and fix it.</p> <p></p> <p>I&#39;m not sure how easy this idea would be, but I think that it would be worth looking into. I think that these days school is only about the last turn in and not reflecting over what went wrong and how to fix it. Hopefully staff and students agree with me that this would be a useful learning experience.</p>

<p>Consider the following case:</p> <p>A player has a hand with a value of 15. This hand contains a soft ace (worth 11). If the player draws a 7, which would give the player a hand with a value of 22, is the player legally allowed to switch the ace to a hard value (worth 1), and then have a value of 12? I don&#39;t know if this is allowed in Blackjack and if we should account for these cases.</p>

<p>For example, when deciding to bet, Competitor would pick a random number between 0 &amp; 1. If the number picked is 0, he bets.

<p>Hey guys,</p> <p></p> <p>Just finishing hand, had a small question.</p> <p></p> <p>I get that Ace can be counted as 11 or 1.

That was my logic for hand but I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s not 100% correct. </p> <p></p> <p>An ace can CHANGE value after another card has been played, correct? </p> <p></p> <p>So if you were dealt a 3 then an Ace, total would be 14.</p> <p>If you are then dealt a queen, total would still be 14. Correct?</p> <p></p> <p>Are we accounting for this change from soft-&gt;hard in Hand.cpp or do we do it later? (Just curious, because I haven&#39;t got to the player functions yet)</p> <p></p> <p>I know in hand.cpp you don&#39;t have access to the cards in the players hand, so I am assuming you account for this change of what the Ace counts as later.</p> <p></p> <p>Can anyone confirm?

<p>So the spec says that the test file should return anything but 0 if the functions are buggy but how do we test for Deck() in this way?</p> <p>For example, instead of declaring each card with the correct rank and suit am I supposed to just use deal to see if the next card is equivalent to the second index of the array etc?</p> <p></p> <p></p>

<TEXT>
<p>For the number of cards remaining, if you deal two cards, then shuffle, then deal another two cards and check how many cards were remaining, it would be 48 right, because the deck was never reset or should the next pointer always be reset to the first card in the deck in the shuffle function, which would make the above answer 2?</p>

<p>Hi Professor DeOrio,<br /><br />My name is Shelby Lewin, and I am a senior studying Information in the BSI. I am currently completing a project for one of my classes, SI 365 (Cyberscience: Computational Science and the Rise of the Fourth Paradigm). This project is a study on Rate My Professor data regarding STEM classes at the University of Michigan. I was wondering if it would be possible for you to please pass along to your current EECS 280 students a survey that my group has created so that we could gather data to aid in our research. Please let me know if this would be possible or if you have any questions; I really appreciate it!<br /><br />The link to the survey is below:</p> <div><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/forms/d/1eBmLpIh246rrjshqnTVu9uwmwHerw8AybFoM7dPI-Z4/viewform?usp=send_form" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/forms/d/1eBmLpIh246rrjshqnTVu9uwmwHerw8AybFoM7dPI-Z4/viewform?usp=send_form</a></div> <div><br />Thank you so much,<br />Shelby <div></div> <div>---<br /> <div>Shelby Ryann Lewin<br />University of Michigan School of Information<br />Bachelor of Science in Information, 2015<br /><a href="mailto:srlewin&#64;umich.edu" target="_blank">srlewin&#64;umich.edu</a></div> </div> </div>

<p>The specs say to subtract one when he sees a face card, but what if the facecard is the fist card he sees? Then his count would be -1? Or is the initial count amount meant to be something other than 0? </p> <p></p> <p>Thanks.</p>

<p>So we decided to keep count inside of the counting player class, but when I write a getter function for the private count variable the compiler tells me that it doesn&#39;t recognize it inside of the Player object. I think this is because I&#39;m creating my counting player variable via the player factor and since up-casting is done at run-time, the compiler will only recognize that variable as the abstract &#34;player&#34; object which doesn&#39;t contain the getCount function. How do I get around this? </p> <p></p> <p>Thanks</p>

<p>Player is dealt a king and a six, so his hand valueis 16. Since this is not a natural 21, he plays his hand (meaning he draws until he either stands or busts). The next card in the deck is Ten of Hearts. Since the Player&#39;s hand value is between 13 and 16, and the card to be dealt is not between 2 and 6, I thought that Player should hit. I don&#39;t understand why, according to blackjack_test00.out.correct, Player stands when given the option to add a Ten to his hand of value 16. </p>

<p>So, when I was creating more memory for more spots in the data array in the lab by doubling it in size, the compiler eventually throws an error which I am assuming is saying that the array has gotten too big.

<p>Dealer is dealt Ace of Clubs, and then Three of Clubs (hole card). That means his value should be 14. After Player plays his hand and then stands, dealer plays his hand. He is first dealt Jack of Spades, which would bring his value to 24. Shouldn&#39;t the hand-playing end here since dealer busts? I don&#39;t understand why in the correct output, dealer is then dealt Eight of Diamonds after already busting.</p> <p>This is the correct output given to us:</p> <p></p> <p>Hand 2 bankroll 95</p> <p>Player bets 5</p> <p>Player dealt King of Hearts</p> <p>Dealer dealt Ace of Clubs</p> <p>Player dealt Seven of Hearts</p> <p>Player&#39;s total is 17</p> <p>Dealer&#39;s hole card is Three of Clubs</p> <p>Dealer dealt Jack of Spades</p> <p>Dealer dealt Eight of Diamonds</p> <p>Dealer&#39;s total is 22</p> <p>Dealer busts</p>

Obviously you don&#39;t want this card to have the value of 11, so add_card should change soft to false right? My hand_is_soft function returns the boolean soft. But in Player.cpp hand_is_soft should still be true since there exists an ace that is counted as 11 in the hand, right? How can I fix this bug?</p> <p></p> <p></p>

<p>Hello, I&#39;m just wondering if I have this right. When you derive a class from a parent class and initialize an instance with a pointer to the parent class, the constructor first runs in the parent class (none or virtual if an ADT) and then runs in the derived class. Then when you delete the class via pointer, the destructor first runs in the derived class and then calls the destructor of the parent class. Is this right? </p>

<p>Hi all,</p> <p>   I had to push back the start of my office hours today. They will start at 5pm instead of 4pm. The change is reflected in the Google Calendar.</p> <p></p> <p>Vidal</p> <p></p> <p>#OfficeHours</p> <p></p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>I&#39;ve added lines of code in both push_back() and grow() to display current size, current number of elements, current capacity, etc, and the first time I call grow(), nothing goes wrong, but then I get this:</p> <p></p> <p>[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]</p> <p>9 filled of 10</p> <p></p> <p>[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]</p> <p>[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]</p> <p>10 filled of 10</p> <p>Calling grow...</p> <p>[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]</p> <p>[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 33, 0, 20, 2]</p> <p>Copying 2 to newData: 2</p> <p></p> <p>... and so on.  After the &#34;calling grow...&#34; line, the next print-out of *data is the first line of code in in grow().  It&#39;s still correct.  Then I create a pointer to a new int(dataCapacity * 2) and reprint *data, as as you can see, it&#39;s no longer correct.  The copying from one array to another still works fine.  When I call grow again, *data changes from [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 33, 0, 20, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] to [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 17, 0, 2, 2, 17, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2].  When calling grow after numElements reaches 40, I receive the message &#34;*** glibc detected *** ./lab09: free(): invalid size: 0x0000000001c1d030&#34; followed by a backtrace and memory map.  Obviously there is an allocation issue when I create the second array.  Any suggestions?</p>

So the spec says to be careful about the integer divison of 3/2.  Are we supposed to pay the player using integer division?   Or do we have to find a way around this to make it what the true payout should be (using casting or something)?  The spec just says to be careful

How can you make cards_remaining() notice the difference between no cards dealts and all 52 cards dealt? Is it possible?  This would lead me to believe that there can only be one unique value for both of these cases: either 52 or 0.  The only way  I think this can be done is creating a cheesy global bool variable and changing it when next gets incremented one time.  Is this allowed?  The reason why this is complicated is because next gets incremented in deal, so *next will be the same for both cases.  Therefore, there is no way to tell the difference without doing something that is considered &#34;bad coding&#34;.

<p>I&#39;m soo confused as to whats going on please help! I called bet on my player and saved the value the player bets into a variable and then asserted that the player indeed bet double the minimum since the count should be two(which i checked and it was)…however I found out using cout statements that its not even going into the bet function, and I have no idea why! Any ideas? am i not calling it right or something…for example its fine to do like;</p> <p>int bet = c-&gt;bet(100,5); right?</p> <p>thanks</p>

<p>The spec says that the dealer hits until either reaching 17 or busting. However, I wanted to clarify this behavior when the player has between 17 and 21. Let&#39;s say the player has 20 points, and the dealer has 14 points. The dealer then hits and gets a four card. He now has 18, which is above 17. However, he/she would still need more points to win the hand, so would they still hit in this instance, or hold just because the hand is worth at least 17?</p>

<p>Our count private variables are defined in Counting and Competitor players. For testing, we are trying to implement a getter function that returns the count. When we do implement a getter function within the derived classes, it is giving us this error:</p> <p></p> <p>&#39;class Player&#39; has no member named &#39;get_count&#39; </p> <p></p> <p>Are we also supposed include the getter function in Simple player? It gives us the same error. </p>

I made counting and competitive subclasses of simple, and declared/defined the draw function in simple. <div><br /></div><div>If i have a pointer to a counting or competitive player and want to call the draw function, i can simply call</div><div><br /></div><div>countingpointer-&gt;draw</div><div>or</div><div>competitivepointer-&gt;draw</div><div><br /></div><div>and it will automatically use simple&#39;s draw function even though i have not declared draw at all in the two subclasses, correct?</div>

<p>Just to confirm, the strategy for whether or not the player wants to hit/stand is the same for simple and counting player, right? The only difference between them is that the counting player makes a more educated wager?</p>

<p>Is there some sort of roundabout way to change the hand value and soft value of a hand without actually &#34;adding cards&#34; to the hand?

<p>For my declaration of the three players at the end of player.cpp, I am receiving an error:</p> <p></p> <p>Player.cpp:153: error: expected initializer before ‘simple_player’<br />Player.cpp: In function ‘Player* player_factory(const char*)’:<br />Player.cpp:164: error: ‘simple_player’ was not declared in this scope<br /><br /></p> <p></p> <p>I declare the three players just like this:</p> <p></p> <p>static Simple simple_player;<br />static Counting counting_player;<br />static Competitor competitor_player;</p> <p></p> <p>so I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m receiving this error for simple player and neither of the other two.

<p>How many deck test cases should we have? I know there isn&#39;t really a concrete answer to this. However, there are only four member functions in the Deck class and isn&#39;t much variety to with what you can test unlike the player test cases with the three derived classes. I am finding these quite repetitive and tedious as I have written seven so far and I&#39;m running out of ideas with what to test. Should each test case be a unique scenario? How many test cases can one write with only four member functions to work with?</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I seem to find discrepancies about if we should implement getters/setters in this project.</p> <p></p> <p>My competitor inherits from counting, but since count is a private member variable I found myself duplicating code to instantiate it, declaring it private again and setting it to 0 in the constructor. Is this alright, or should I be writing a getter/setter function to access this? Either way, it seems like I need to have some extra code to set it equal to 0 at the construction of my competitor player...</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks.</p>

<p>So I have deduced that I have a memory error somewhere in my shuffle function that is causing unrelated variables to change values unexpectedly.

<p>Say you have an ace counted as an 11. Can it change to be counted as a 1 as you add more cards to the hand? Or once you count it as 11 it is indefinitely counted as 11?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
<p>So just to be sure, we should only print the player/dealer hand values once per hand? (as in, we don&#39;t print the hand value until the player stops asking for cards or busts, and same for the dealer)</p> <p></p> <p>Also, when shuffling, do we print after or before the hand line prints?</p> <p></p> <p>(ie: </p> <p>Hand 3 bankroll 100....</p> <p>Shuffling....</p> <p></p> <p>or</p> <p></p> <p>Shuffling....</p> <p>Hand 3 bankroll 100.....</p> <p>)</p>

<p>When you use the function get_rank, it returns a value that is not truly representative of the Card&#39;s actual rank. For example, if you call get rank of a Two, it returns 0 because of enum layout of the array of card ranks. Should we be creating a helper function that returns card&#39;s actual rank by calling get_rank and adding 2? In other words, will we get points of if we say:</p> <p>if (c.get_rank() == 0)</p> <p>when we&#39;re really checking if the card&#39;s rank equals 2?

<p>EDIT: Updated the title</p> <p></p> <p>In other words, how long until the autograder (or person grader) gets sick of letting the test cases, cuts it off, and says it&#39;s a failure?</p> <p></p> <p>I ask, as my player test just for counting takes about... 13^2*~10000000 &#43; 13^4*10000000 computations. Basically, I&#39;m testing every darn possibility on multiple levels. In other words, for every possible exposing set of cards of size n (which has 13^n possibilities), do either one set of 10000000 or another 10000000 tests (based off of the player&#39;s count). Oh, and plus another set of tests for something else.</p> <p></p> <p>Too much fun with for loops. At the moment, I have a bug and just letting it cout a little bit of information for every test (~3 couts) as I have some sort of error (either in Player.cpp or in my tests). Without couting, the process as is takes only &lt;6 seconds. With couting, it still hasn&#39;t reached the error since I went to Piazza.<br /><br />So, a better question would be: What would be reasonable? I&#39;m not sure how crazy the bugs would be, including exposing the player a hundred cards and on the 101th, there&#39;s a bug to reset the count to 0. What are the limits to the insane possibilities of bugs the given player.cpp&#39;s will have? A &#34;reasonable&#34; student - as the bugs seem to be based off of that - could do anything. And apparently doing stress&#43;boundary tests at the same time is a really bad decision.<br /><br />Help...</p> <p>Oh, 281 will be such hellish fun...</p>

<p>In our Player.cpp, do we first declare our classes and then below all that do the implementations, or can we simply do that all at once? </p> <p></p> <p>In other words, (simplified example) do we write it like</p> <pre>class Simple: public Player {    public:     int bet(unsigned int bankroll, unsigned int minimum); };<br /><br />//counting and competitor<br /><br />int Simple::bet(unsigned int bankroll, unsigned int minimum)<br />{<br />	//implementation<br />}</pre> <p>or can we just write</p> <p></p> <pre>class Simple: public Player {    public:     int bet(unsigned int bankroll, unsigned int minimum)     {         //implementation     }<br />};<br /><br />//counting and competitor</pre> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Additionally, if a function definition doesn&#39;t change across players, do we need to re-implement the functions with the same code, or can we just omit them?</p>

<p>Say for example, our player has 18 total and the dealer has three aces and a 4, most players would count it as a seven and hit again but our dealer stays because he already counted it as soft and has 17. Is this correct? Does he just lose? Thanks!</p>

<p>I have been going through the posts on here and it seems like everyone has a conflicting answer to this, so I am asking just the instructors for a final answer: Are we allowed to use protected member variables in our subclasses? For instance, I derive my counting player from my simple player, and then I want to derive my competitor player from my counting player, including member variables. Do the member variables in my counting subclass have to be private, or can I make them protected so as to avoid using excess helper functions? Or is there something drastic I&#39;m missing and this solution is wrong entirely?</p> <p></p> <p>EDIT: Also, I think this is obvious, but I just want to be sure: Are we to assume there is only one player at the table at a time?</p>

<p>Has anyone else tried looking for a difference in output between counting and simple&#39;s bets? I know that counting is supposed to changed his betting strategy if his count gets to 2. But I made them play 10 hands and I&#39;m couting the count at every expose() call and the count literally never gets to 2... in fact it ends up in the negatives for a majority of the time. So there is never a difference in output for me using simple or counting. I have the count reset every time the deck is shuffled (which is rarely) and I know I&#39;m adding/subtracting the count at the right times because I&#39;m following the count line by line using cout. Is this supposed to be happening?</p>

<p>In the spec, it says that the simple player will always bet the minimum. The counting player also always bets the minimum if count &lt; 2. It doesn&#39;t mention anything about the case where the minimum is higher than the bankroll until the driver program section. So when testing Player.cpp, if the minimum is higher than the bankroll, will the bet function still return the minimum, or does it not matter?</p>

<p>I was wondering if we had to test the draw function separately for simple player, counting player and competitor. They all do the same thing right, so if I test one its like im testing the others?</p> <p></p>

<TEXT>
<p>If both the player and dealer are dealt a natural 21, wouldn&#39;t we never know about the dealer since we just proceed with the next hand once we know the player has a natural 21?</p>

<p>I wanted to change my betting function for certain values of count.</p> <p></p> <p>I read other posts about get_count(), which doesn&#39;t work since you are using a Player *, but get_count() is not declared in &#34;Player.h&#34;</p> <p></p> <p>How should I obtain count in my derived class, competitor?</p> <p></p> <p>Would I have to make competitor be a derived class of Simple, and copy paste the expose and shuffled code?</p>

<p>Hi, I did not receive the pre-lab survey for lab 10. I believe this is because I switched in to EECS280 after the start of the semester. I recall there being an email about pre- and post-lab surveys for a prior lab, and I did not receive those emails either. Thus, my email is probably not on the email list for lab survey emails. May I be sent the lab 10 pre-lab survey and my email added to the list? My email is <a href="mailto:hardyxu&#64;umich.edu">hardyxu&#64;umich.edu</a></p> <p></p> <p>Thanks</p>

<p>In the spec for the rules of an ace (if any) being hard, it says if the player&#39;s hand totals 11 or less , he always hits.&#34;</p> <p></p> <p>Is this scenario of the hand total is less than 11 with a hard ace ever even possible?</p> <p></p> <p>For example, for the ace card to be more advantageous for the either player, it would be assigned 11 (soft) off the bat if total hand count is still under 21. For any situation when total hand count goes over 21 and ace is still 11(soft), then ace would turn to hard (1). 22 is the lowest number to bust, thus 22 - 11 = 11 means the other non-ace cards add up to 11 and we cannot change these values. Thus, soft ace changed to hard ace would lead to 22-11&#43;1= 12. </p> <p></p> <p>Another example, if two aces are the first two dealt cards to the player, then total hand count would be 12 to be more advantageous to the player. Thus, hand count less than 11 will a hard count could not apply here. </p> <p></p> <p>...I just can&#39;t think of an example where this specification would be true and I am not sure how to go about it for writing a test case.</p>

<p>I am having difficulty figuring out exactly how command line arguments should be used. I think I may have missed the memo when we went over this. I have currently</p> <p></p> <p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]){<br /> //initialize key variables/constants from command line<br /> int bankroll = argv[1];<br /> int const maxhands = argv[2];<br /> Player* player = player_factory(argv[3]);</p> <p></p> <p>and I keep getting</p> <p></p> <p>error: invalid conversion from &#39;char*&#39; to &#39;int&#39;</p> <p></p> <p>for the first two lines after main. Should be dereferencing argv[1] and argv[2]? I&#39;m completely lost here.</p>

<p>Since we&#39;re testing bet based on expose, testing expose based on bet and testing shuffled based on expose and bet, does that mean that if bet is buggy, all these tests including expose and shuffled would fail? Or is it considered false negatives?</p>

<p>Can we assume that the .h files will be correct when testing? For instance, all the function names and input/output types will be valid, only the implementations will be incorrect?</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve read through the Piazza posts and I still don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve implemented my get_rank() function properly. All I do is: return rank;</p> <p>I account for the fact that the number this produces is 2 less than the rank later in the files by adding 2 to the values</p> <p>However, I do compare cards by using get_rank() == Card::TWO for example</p> <p>Is this incorrect?</p> <p>I don&#39;t want to change this because then I&#39;m worried if I don&#39;t simple return rank I won&#39;t be able to compare cards in the get_rank() == Card::TWO way</p> <p>I just don&#39;t know if this would properly pass the instructors&#39; test cases</p>

<p>In the spec it states: &#34;be sure to expose() any face-up cards to the player.&#34; for the initial Deal.</p> <p></p> <p>Does this mean expose all face-up cards dealt (including the one to the dealer) or expose JUST the face-up cards dealt to the player?</p> <p></p> <p>thanks!</p> <p></p>

<p>When I try to compile my files together, I get pages of errors saying undefined reference any time I call any member function of any class in my blackjack.cpp. I am #including all .h files in blackjack.cpp and am typing the command line exactly as given with all files included, yet it seems to think either there are no .h files or they are linked to nothing.</p> <p></p> <p>EDIT: Resolved.</p>

<p>I was looking back through piazza and I noticed it said that apparently we weren&#39;t supposed to include deck.h in our player tests (which i think i confirmed in the spec; its not 100% clear to me).  We did include deck.h in our player tests and submitted because we didn&#39;t realize this was a rule.  Are we going to fail all of our player tests because of this?</p> <p></p> <p>EDIT: I just checked and it seems like the tests should work without deck.h. So we really just have deck.h included while it isn&#39;t needed, will we be okay?</p>

<p>If we used deck in our player tests, does that mean we will receive no credit for our player tests? We only used the deal function of deck to quickly generate cards to test with.

<p>I completed lab10 and I am ready to submit. However, even though I passed all tests and got the correct results, when I run the code in Labster, there remained a deallocated memory location on the heap. When I run the code I found out that at one point memory address 0x9960 is allocated for vec2. So, I went to my code, and added if (capacity &gt; 0) delete[] data; and it fixed the issue. I essentially checked if data was already allocated once, and if it was deallocated it before making a new copy.</p> <p></p> <p>However, even though it passes all tests and leaves no memory leak, I don&#39;t assume this was the right way to do it. On the other hand, the first code I wrote seemed correct, it passed all tests but there was a memory leak at 0x9960. Did I hit a Labster bug? It doesn&#39;t really make sense. Did anyone else have same issue? Thanks.</p> <p> </p> <p>EDIT: Nevermind, apparently the lab specs already told to do what I did to fix memory leak. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a little uncertain on how to submit lab10. In the instruction for submitting, it said: </p> <p>To turn them in, just copy/paste from Labster into the box on CTools</p> <p>or into a separate file and then attach that to your submission.</p> <p></p> <p>Are we copying the codes (including all of the functions and main)  from Labster and pasting it to the submission box?</p>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
Lab 10 spec says that for the capacity and numElems members we should initialize them with an initializer list and then says like two lines later that labster doesn&#39;t support it. Does this mean that they way they already have it is correct?

<p>1. In the lecture slides, the function for Iterator&#39;s overloaded * operator is</p> <pre>T&amp; operator* ()</pre> <p>and the function for the Iterator&#39;s overloaded &#43;&#43; operator is</p> <pre>Iterator&amp; operator&#43;&#43; ()</pre> <p>However, I don&#39;t understand the reason for the return type having the address-of operator after it. I implemented both of these functions without the ampersand and I am not experiencing compiler errors. Are they really necessary?</p> <p> </p> <p>2. In Rational.h, the various overloaded operator functions were all declared outside of the Rational class, so they&#39;re not members of the Rational class. However, in Iterator, the various overloaded operators are declared inside the Iterator class, so they&#39;re treated as members of Iterator (in the lecture slides, they are declared inside Iterator as well). Why is one set declared outside the class while another set is declared within the class? Is there any special reason? It couldn&#39;t be an issue with node_ptr being private, since I&#39;ve declared List as a friend to Iterator, so would it be possible to declare Iterator&#39;s overloaded operators outside Iterator and inside List and for them to still work?</p>

<p>So we know that First/Last should point to 0 if list is empty. But I&#39;m confused on what to do with next/prev if there is only 1 thing inside of the list. Should next/prev point to 0 if there isn&#39;t a node before or after?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit confused when the spec tells us not to modify the public interface. Does this mean that we should implement the functions outside of the class definition?

<p>I was hoping to implement a small helper funtion in one of my Stack_test cases to that would take a Stack as input. I do not wish to modify the Stack passed as input so I therefore do not want to use pass by reference/pointer. I was curious if I will need to utilize a copy construcor or not.</p> <p></p> <p>From what I can tell, all of the storage for the Stack class is handled by its private member variable &#34;list.&#34; The functions of Stack themselves will not be creating any dynamic variables, but its member functions will make calls to functions in List which will create/destroy dynamic variables. As Stack won&#39;t be directly managing any dynamic memory, I thought it might not need a copy constructor.</p> <p></p> <p>However, I became confused when I thought about how the member variable &#34;list&#34; which does allocate dynamic memory would be copied without a Stack copy constructor.</p> <p></p> <p>To sum up my question: If I have a copy constructor for a member variable of a class, and I am not creating/destroying dynamic variables directly within the class, do I need to create a copy constructor for the class?</p> <p></p> <p>I had a pretty hard time trying to explain this, so please let me know if further clarification of my question would be helpful!</p>

I am looking at list_compile_check.cpp and it makes a list, my_list, fills it with 42s then empties it calling removeFront and removeBack.  At this point first and last both point to 0 because it&#39;s an empty list.  Then an iterator, iter, is created by setting iter = my_list.begin().  my_list.begin() returns 0 because my_list is empty, so iter points to 0.  Then my_list.insert(iter,42) is called which inserts one element--42--into my_list, but iter still points to 0.  Then my_list.erase(iter) gives me an error: &#34;Access violation reading location 0x00000004.  Where am I going wrong here?  I feel like iter should point to the first item (which would be 42) but it still points to 0.  I can&#39;t just set iter to the first item in the list because it is passed by value.

<p>I was passing the asserts in List_test00.cpp, but I kept getting a segmentation fault, and upon inspection, found that it was due to something in removeFront(). Before setting first to first-&gt;next, I was trying to set (first-&gt;next)-&gt;prev to 0, because it&#39;s going to become the new first element. After that, I assigned first = first-&gt;next, followed by deleting the &#34;victim&#34; node. Upon removing the line (first-&gt;next)-&gt;prev = 0, I had no seg fault. I guess I&#39;m having a hard time understanding why this is causing a problem, because if I don&#39;t change this node&#39;s prev, the it is going to be pointing to deleted memory, the original &#34;first&#34; before calling removeFront().

<p>Hi, I have question about the term &#34;invalided&#34; (which has been mentioned a lot by instructors answering all sort of question related to erase( ) ):</p> <p></p> <p>Since we are making the erase function pass by value, there is no way to really &#34;invalidate&#34; the iterator inside</p> <p>the erase function. Even if I make the node_ptr of iterator points to null, it just invalidate the copy of the iterator, the node_ptr in the original iterator is still pointing to that piece of memory(the erased node) we just recycled.  </p> <p>Wouldn&#39;t that be a issue? For the iterator is still sticking with a node &#34;erased&#34;, rather than points to null? </p>

<p>first question, can the iterator point to a NULL such that it&#39;s technically pointing past the end of the list? If so, would that mean an iterator pointing to a NULL does not necessarily mean it&#39;s pointing to an empty list, but it could be pointing to the end of the list?</p> <p></p> <p>Then in that case, for the insert function, do we have to account for when the iterator is pointing to the end of the list so that it can insert into the back of the list or do we not have to worry about that situation because we have insertBack? Also, same for inserting to the beginning of a list because we already have a insertFront.</p>

<p>should we be checking if we are removing an element from a list with only one element in RemoveFront()? if we remove an element from a list with only one element then first and last should point to the same thing and we would have to reset both first and last to 0 as well, correct?</p>

<p>I&#39;m having issues using overloaded operators in my Stack.h file.

I&#39;ve tried messing with typename, double checked my operator implementations, and made sure I had friend declarations. Do I have to use the scope resolution operator on the overloaded operators?</p> <p></p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p></p> <p>No, they&#39;re under the public section of the Iterator class.

<p>I&#39;m a little confused about how we should be writing things in calc.cpp. Do we write assignment operator overload functions for the various commands?

<p>I don&#39;t quite understand the point of the list_compile_check.cpp test function. From my understanding so far, the function:</p> <p>1. creates a list</p> <p>2. adds two datums</p> <p>3. removes those two datums (list is now null/empty)</p> <p>4. constructs an iterator that points to the beginning of the list (the iterator is consequently NULL)</p> <p>5. attempts to insert a datum before the iterator (before NULL space)</p> <p>6. erases the NULL pointer</p> <p>7. attempts to &#43;&#43; the NULL pointer</p> <p>8. attempts to dereference a NULL pointer</p> <p></p> <p>In my opinion, this test case is either a really hard corner test case or just an improper test case. It&#39;s also a requirement for the overloaded &#43;&#43; operator that the iterator is not NULL.</p> <p></p> <p>Is anyone else having these problems? my list.h works on a normal list test perfectly fine.</p>

Any advice? Or does anybody see a mistake that we might be making? Thanks!</p>

<p>I&#39;m testing my destructor on a list of pointers to dynamic ints, and when I run the erase() function on this list I&#39;m realizing that erase() only deletes the node and the pointer, not the int that it actually points to.

I understand that I should need to delete these pointers in the erase() function but there&#39;s no way to tell if it&#39;s a pointer, and if you try to delete something that isn&#39;t a pointer the compiler throws errors.</p> <p></p> <p></p>

<p>In testing my code on the Linux command line, giving the input &#34;3&#34; puts the rational 3/1 into the stack and giving the input &#34;200&#34; puts the rational 200/1 on the stack, but giving the input &#34;200 3&#34; places the rationals 200/1 and 300/1 on the stack in the correct order.</p> <p></p> <p>Inputs are grabbed from the command line via getline(cin, string) and are pulled apart in a smaller loop via strings.

<p>While we were testing that &#34;a&#34; command in calc, our ostream operator goes into an infinite loop and keeps printing everything on the stack.  We tried to print the stack with the overloaded ostream using the iterators in a for loop with this condition:</p> <p></p> <p>for (typename List&lt;U&gt;::Iterator i=obj.list.begin(); i != obj.list.end(); &#43;&#43;i)</p> <p></p> <p>We found that when the iterator reaches the last node, &#43;&#43;i does not point the iterator to null, it instead points to the same place.  This is the line we used to set the &#43;&#43;i pointer:</p> <p></p> <p>node_ptr = node_ptr-&gt;next;</p> <p></p> <p>Is this how the &#43;&#43;i operator is supposed to work?  If so, how do we account for that in the for loop?

<p>We are having trouble getting our overloaded &#43;&#43; operator for Iterator to compile. The trouble seems to be due to the fact that we are returning a reference to an Iterator, and the compiler won&#39;t recognize the Iterator as a type, which might mean our scoping syntax is off. The compiler is flagging the name of our function with this error:</p> <p></p> <p>expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before ‘&amp;’ token<br /><br /></p> <p>Our definition is structured as follows:</p> <p></p> <p>Iterator&amp; List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator::operator&#43;&#43; () //compiler flags this line with an error</p> <p>{</p> <p>   //Implementation</p> <p>}</p> <p></p> <p>Any thoughts/help would be appreciated.

<p>I am having trouble with the single print and top function.  I can call the single print once, but then if called again it causes the program to crash.  Also, after calling p, any other command results in a segmentation fault.  I think it has something to do with the top() function, but i dont know what it could be as my top function uses an iterator but no pointers.</p> <p></p> <p>any ideas?</p>

<p>so for some reason when i input &#34;100000 10000 / p  a &#34;in my calc.cpp, it prints 0/0. I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s doing this. it works well for other division that I had been testing. and i overloaded the &#34;/&#34; operator and in my calc.cpp i&#39;m only dividing two rational numbers.

<p>I have an assert statement at the beginning of my removeFront() that makes sure that the list is not empty. Everything works fine, however when I started writing my own list tests it keeps evaluating the assert statement before and after the last element is removed even though I only wrote it at the beginning of my function and it is therefore throwing an error that the list is empty, exiting my program. Is there something about assert that it constantly is evaluating the truth of it&#39;s predicate or is this something else?</p>

<p>The RME for erase() only requires that i be a valid iterator. I&#39;ve seen it mentioned in several posts that an iterator that points to NULL (points &#34;past the end&#34;) is indeed a valid iterator. What, then, should the specific behavior for the erase() function be when used with an iterator that points past the end? The effects clause just says the function will remove an item in the list. How do we determine what item to remove if the iterator points to NULL? What should happen if the List is empty? Or should the function do nothing in either case? I guess I&#39;m just a little confused by the wording in the RME. Any help or clarification would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>

I passed all tests in the autograder at one point, but I changed my code a little and theres extra spaces and a mysterious newline that I cant&#39; figure out.  I am confused as for the inputs, do they all just go together at once?  When I do that, my program is off by a couple spaces and a line at the start.  If the autograder gets inputs line by line, my program works correctly.  EX:1   2 / 3 4 / -  a c 4 1 / 0 1000000 / d d d d d d d d d &#43; &#43; &#43; &#43; &#43; &#43; &#43; &#43; &#43; &#43;  a-1/4   4  The Correct output should be: -1/4 4

<p>There seems to be conflicting statements about disabling assert statements. In stack, some of the requires clauses require you to have assert statements, so turning off the assert statements seem to violate this. And putting #define DNDEBUG in list.h, disables the assert statements in the test cases as another piazza post said. This should be fine, after all testing is done, but I just wanted to make sure, this is correct.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>So my actual question is should we do #define DNDEBUG in stack even though it would technically violate the requires clause?</p>

<p>Hello, all!

The first element if (1/1) (Which is correct for this), but then it goes and tries to print (637940 / 0) and then an undefined rational which causes the segfault. If someone could help me find a problem here, I would really appreciate it, since I&#39;m not sure what could be causing this. </p>

<p>What exactly is the problem with protected member variables? From the lecture slides, it seems that the problem is that it is easy to use or change only the variables that the programmer or user wants to change directly without changing other variables (e.g. acute in Lecture 11) that also need to change with the desired variables. Is this the issue? Are there other problems with protected variables beyond this?</p>

<p>Just to make sure I understand correctly: default copy constructors and assignment operators not implemented by a programmer do not make new copies of dynamic memory when copying classes because that dynamic memory is not a member of the class, but is merely pointed to by another class member variable.

Is there a formal C&#43;&#43; definition of virtual that would help to understand situations like this? Also what would happen if the derived class function had virtual and the parent class function didnt?</p>

<p>Consider this code</p> <pre>class Rectangle {<br />  public:<br />    virtual ~Rectangle() {<br />      cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Rectangle dtor\n&#34; &lt;&lt; endl;<br />    }<br />};<br /><br />class Square : public Rectangle {<br />  public:<br />    ~Square() {<br />      cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Square dtor\n&#34; &lt;&lt; endl;<br />    }<br />};</pre> <p>My question is similar to the previous piazza post regarding virtual functions, but with destructors. What difference does it make when you have virtual in front of the base class destructor and not the derived class destructor? And the other way around? Should they both always run because the derived destructor runs, all the way down to the base class destructor? Is the word virtual even needed?</p>

<p>I know destructors are <strong>needed</strong> when a class allocates memory dynamically…however if a class is not dynamically allocating memory it doesn&#39;t need a destructor? However, doesn&#39;t the compiler add one for you if you don&#39;t explicitly add one for EVERY class? Im asking because in a few practice exams I saw that there are classes which don&#39;t use any dynamic memory yet they still have destructors with cout statements and all…so does this mean that they do exist in every class but do nothing basically?</p>

<p>Lets say we have a hierarchy of Food--&gt;Produce---&gt;Fruit</p> <p></p> <p>We call Fruits custom constructor, does it also run the other custom constructors above the hierarchy in this order like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Food ctor</p> <p>Produce ctor</p> <p>Fruit ctor</p> <p></p> <p>Is this the same way a default constructor behaves too?</p>

<p>What it says on the tin.  I visited my friend here when she was an undergrad -- about seven years ago -- and I know where the large North Campus library is and the general layout from entering whatever road it is (that&#39;s just off of the road with the hospital and Angelo&#39;s on it) to the dorms, but building names are beyond my recollection.  Additionally, does anyone know the closest place to park with the Student Orange permit that will not result in fees incurred/my car getting towed?  I commute from quite a distance, and usually park in the Stadium lot...</p> <p></p> <p>(There are maps and the like, I know, but I&#39;ve actually always been abysmal at reading them.  I tend to mix the left and right sides up and always end up the opposite direction from where I need to go.)</p>

<p>if you throw an exception that is inside of a try block, how is that different from throwing an exception outside of a try block? Prof DeOrio said in the Ecxeptions lecture at about 1|08 that we were not inside a try block. I was just wondering what would happen if in fact we were inside of one.</p> <p></p> <p>also, does there always have to be a try block before one or more catch blocks, or could we just have a stand alone catch?</p>

Is the grade on CTools our final grade, or just our autograder score? Will we be getting another email that contains autograder &#43; hand-graded results?

<p>I had gotten to thinking about tail call recursion and compiler optimization of it today, and realized it&#39;s maybe not always safe to do.</p> <p>Looking at clang&#39;s output (LLVM 3.5 if it matters) I see for a trivial example it does indeed optimize away tail call recursion:</p> <pre>int factTail_helper(int n, int soFar){<br />  if (n == 1) { return soFar; }<br />  else {<br />    return factTail_helper(n-1, n*soFar);<br />  }<br />}</pre> <p>becomes the following:</p> <pre>__Z15factTail_helperii:                 ## &#64;_Z15factTail_helperii<br />	.cfi_startproc<br />## BB#0:<br />	pushq	%rbp<br />Ltmp2:<br />	.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16<br />Ltmp3:<br />	.cfi_offset %rbp, -16<br />	movq	%rsp, %rbp<br />Ltmp4:<br />	.cfi_def_cfa_register %rbp<br />	jmp	LBB0_2<br />	.align	4, 0x90<br />LBB0_1:                                 ## %tailrecurse<br />                                        ##   in Loop: Header=BB0_2 Depth=1<br />	imull	%edi, %esi<br />	decl	%edi<br />LBB0_2:                                 ## %tailrecurse<br />                                        ## =&gt;This Inner Loop Header: Depth=1<br />	cmpl	$1, %edi<br />	jne	LBB0_1<br />## BB#3:                                ## %tailrecurse._crit_edge<br />	movl	%esi, %eax<br />	popq	%rbp<br />	retq<br />	.cfi_endproc</pre> <p>It&#39;s straightforward to see the base case where we compare against 1, jump otherwise to the integer multiply and decrement of n, and loop as needed for the recursive case.</p> <p>But because this is C&#43;&#43;, we can break this fragile optimization rather easily: for example, make the function-scope ending brace do something significant by allocating an object on the stack that has a nontrivial destructor.</p> <p></p> <p>Are there any more subtle things we should watch out for because they would cause such an optimization to not be done? Is there a safe way to still optimize here, even though we potentially have a destructor to worry about?</p> <p></p> <p>(Hopefully such a question is not totally ill suited to piazza even though the semester is over! Thanks for everything, GSIs, professors, and students alike :D)</p>
