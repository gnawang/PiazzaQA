Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:
1.  Ask questions!
The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).
2.  Edit questions and answers wiki-style.
Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors’ answer for instructors).
3.  Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.
To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.
4.  Go anonymous.
Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.
5.  Tag your posts.
It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.
6.  Format code and equations.
Adding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. 
Mathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.
7.  View and download class details and resources.
Click the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!
Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at team@piazza.com. We love feedback!

Am I correct in assuming that month 12 (the first month printed) is where we begin accumulating the loan amt, with the balance at month 1 at the bottom being the solution?  
And regarding the formula in computing the first month's balance, principal and interest, exactly how do we work in the given equation of B' = B * (1+r/12) - P seeing how we don't have any prior knowledge of the previous month's balance? I initially thought on your first month of paying, it'd begin as $100, and then you'd start multiplying by r/12 every month to calculate interest.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Initial outstanding balance</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hint #1: you might need to rearrange a formula using algebra</p>
<p>Hint #2: the ending loan balance should be 0</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think you have the balance backwards, it doesn't start with how much you pay it off in the first month (principal), but instead starts as the amount you owe (loan size).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
In that case, how do we go about calculating loan size?  Referring to the example problem - $500 monthly payment, 6% interest for 5 yrs giving us a loan size of $25862.78.
$500/month for 5 yrs = $30000 total, hence $4137.22 of that consists of compound interest, and I don't know how they got this. I'd appreciate a hint to get me started on how to do this.  Are we supposed to use the given formulas for outstanding balance/principal calculation and do multiple calculations of this for each month or is it something that can be done in a single computation?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
[(500*12) - (500*0.06 )] + [(Previous result*12) - (Previous result*0.06 )] etc. for 3 more times.  The final sum didn't match.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Above is what I tried</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
sorry change (500*.06) to (500* 12 * .06)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
and (Previous result*12) to just (Previous result), the entire calculation gave me $25,013.01</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Okay, I'm going explain the output of the example problem and hopefully it clears things up a bit (I have a hunch that is all you need): </p>

<p>eg. rate: 5%, payment: $100, 1 year duration</p>

<p>You initially take out a lone $1168.12, and that's the balance that's due at the end of the month. Over the course of that first month the lone accumulates $4.87 of interest, which you immediately pay off with the money you have set aside. The remainder of that money (principal) is used to pay off the balance $95.13. Leaving you with $1072.99 of the loan due at the end of the second month. </p>

<p>It is possible to do the calculation both month by month and all in one jump; however, if you look at the program specifications one of them should make more sense to use. If you use the two hints that Dr. DeOrio posted, it gives you an initial condition to solve the differential equation, that is in the project prompt.</p>

<p>I hope this helps your train of thought, the project is essentially just this calculation so I can't do it for you.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>maybe it's part of the problem, so you can't answer, but how would you know what the initial loan value (of $1168.12) is?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You would know the initial loan value because your program, if set up right, will calculate it for you. Since you're starting from the final month of the loan and working down to the initial month of the loan, the only thing you know right off the bat is that the final outstanding balance on the loan is 0. From there, you do some calculations using the formulas given in the project spec, and you're left in the final column with what your initial loan balance would be - i.e. how much car you could afford. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Understood. However, I'm trying to understand the example output since our numbers don't match.  Based on the instructions, here was how is how I understood the process.  
The first $100 for monthly payment:
Interest = 100 * (0.05/12)
Principal = 100 - Interest
Outstanding Balance = Result of the principal
The 2nd monthly 
Interest = Previous month’s balance * (0.05/12)
Principal = 100 – calculated interest
Outstanding Balance = Result of the principal + previous month’s outstanding balance</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Would I call the PrintMonthlyData function after calculating the balance for each month? or would I do all the calculations then call PrintMonthlyData 12 times consecutively??</p>
<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, you are going to have to write a loop somewhere. I cannot think of a way to do all the calculations all at once. You should call PrintMonthlyData after each calculation, but make sure to only all PrintHeader once.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I get how I could calculate it using the equations given, but this would be done from month to month meaning I'd have to use the calculation many times rather than all at once. If I do it this way, won't it be rather inefficient due to the large amount of code?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes. The project spec has all you need - just read it carefully.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Professor DeOrio gave a hint that we might need to rearrange a formula algebraically. I just used one of the equations given without rearranging it. Is it necessary to rearrange one?</p></TEXT>

<p>If you're connecting to a Linux box with VNC, you'll be using GCC via the Terminal (command line). <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~beechung/ref/gcc-intro.html" target="_blank">Here's a quick tutorial</a> on getting started with GCC. If you're used to using an IDE like Visual Studio, this will be a little different. All you'll need is a text editor (I use <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> on Windows or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a> on Linux) and a terminal window. For larger projects with non-standard libraries, you need to create make files for compile-time linking. Right now you don't need to worry about that since we're limited to using std. If you use features from C++11, make sure you compile with the flag "-std=c++11" (also, we should check with the instructors that it's OK to use it).</p>

<p>In the instructions for Project 1, the compiler settings for the project are given. Make sure your program compiles using the exact command line argument shown in that PDF.</p>

<p>Another option is to use a GCC port for Windows on your home computer (assuming you use Windows--if you're on a Mac, I can't help you). Either <a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/HOWTO" target="_blank">MinGW</a> or <a href="http://devtidbits.com/2011/07/01/cygwin-walkthrough-and-beginners-guide-is-it-linux-for-windows-or-a-posix-compatible-alternative-to-powershell/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> will be the way to go. I prefer Cygwin, as it's more full-featured. It also has SSH support, so we should be able to use it to connect to the CAEN environment and upload assignments without pulling out VNC or PuTTY. If you install Cygwin, make sure you check "gcc-g++" under the Devel group and "openssh" under Net. The installer will automatically select other dependent packages--let it install those as well.</p>

<p>If you'd like any help setting up your environment, I'd be happy to assist. Look for Rich Starbuck in class, or email me at <a href="mailto:rstarbuc@umich.edu">rstarbuc@umich.edu</a>.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Another option that works on Mac is to connect to CAEN through SSH, which is often smoother and more reliable than VNC. To do this, open Terminal and type</p>

<pre>ssh uniqname@login.engin.umich.edu</pre>
<p>(where "uniqname" is replaced with yours.) This will give you the same command line environment you'd get on an actual CAEN machine running Linux.</p></TEXT>

You may use whatever text editor/IDE you feel comfortable using in Linux. 
Here are a few more options based on what I personally use:
Eclipse is a cross-platform IDE, and will feel fairly familiar if you're used to using xcode or visual studio. http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/
Sublime Text is a text editor that has some fancy text-editing tricks and is more powerful than gedit (a very vanilla Linux text editor), but will require installing a bunch of plugins if you want it to function like an IDE. http://www.sublimetext.com
Experiment with some different programs and go with whatever feels the most comfortable. 
If you end up going the eclipse route, Vidal Borromeo, Jay Satonik, and I have experience using eclipse and can answer questions in office hours.
To answer Nathan's question about c++11, no, we won't be using c++11.</TEXT>

Lecture Section</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This is a very unofficial answer (I would wait for instructor confirmation) but from asking a few people who took the course previously you can attend any lecture and discussion section.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, you can attend any lecture or discussion section (as long as there are enough seats, but apparently this hasn't been an issue in the past).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Will all lecture sections receive the same projects to do?</p>
<p>In other words, can we partner with someone who is in another lecture section than ours to do the projects?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Projects</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If 183 was any indication, the answer will most likely be yes. Each lecture has the same projects.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes. All sections will have the same projects and it is fine to partner with someone who attends a different lecture.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry if this is a silly question, but are we to only modify the io.cpp file and leave the .h file alone?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Project 1 question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If I understand the project correctly, neither of those will be modified; the "io.h" file should be accessed in the header of the separate program that you create. I believe the "io.cpp" is just for our reference so we can see how the "io.h" file was constructed, as well as what functions it contains.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Correct!</p>

<p>We can also note that io.h doesn't show up in the compilation command because we #include it from p1.cpp.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I may be wrong, but I think we are suppposed to use io.cpp but not edit it</p>

<p>I think the line in the project pdf</p>

<p>g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror -O1 p1.cpp io.cpp -o p1</p>

<p>means that we are compiling both io.cpp and our own file (p1.cpp) to use in the executable file p1</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You don't need to modify the io.cpp or io.h files. The io.h file contains declarations for all of the functions you want to use, and the io.cpp file contains the implementations of those functions (i.e. the "actual code" that makes them work). While it's not a bad idea to refer to the io.h file, you can safely ignore the io.cpp file as long as you make sure to include it in your compilation command (see follow up below).</p></TEXT>

<p>Oh sorry, so we code the same way we did in 183, but we submit our work using the linux software</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can use XCode for 280.  Just make sure you test your code on CAEN Linux.  (compile, run, check output).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, that would work fine. You can use any text editor and the terminal window to test/submit.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So we can just get remote access to Linux on our laptops, and just use like g-edit and a terminal window?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I can't comment on whether it would work for sure since I don't have a mac. It could work but there are no guarantees.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Errors may not be present when compiling basic programs with compilers on different OSs this early into the course. However, differences in the ways compilers on differing OSs understand code could(most likely will) arise when dealing with memory management(i.e. pointers, etc.) because of the way the compilers will interact with the OSs to deal with memory. Proceed at your OWN DISCRETION, but I choose to heed the warnings of the professors early into the course knowing that problems(like the aforementioned) could arise later in the semester, even if they don't in the early weeks, because of bad habits.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I was wondering why differences would arise when the code is compiled in the g++ linux compiler as opposed to the mac one? Do the compilers treat certain code differently ?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In a perfect world, all compilers would produce the same output (running program) given the same input (your code).  Unfortunately, this is not always true.  It is usually safe to assume they will all get the same answer when code follows the ANSII C++ standard (<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/info/faq/,">http://www.cplusplus.com/info/faq/</a> search for "ANSII"), and when code doesn't do anything "bad", like abusing pointers, going off the end of an array, or uninitialized variables.  If code uses features that aren't part of the standard, even by accident, or if code makes some common mistakes, different compilers or computers could get different answers.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre>int sum;<br />sum += 1;<br />cout &lt;&lt; "sum = " &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; "\n";</pre>
<p>Compile and run it.  Some machines will produce this output because they automatically initialize chunks of memory to zero:</p>
<pre>sum = 1</pre>
<p>Some machines will produce something like this, using whatever random number that was in the memory location now used by <tt>sum</tt></p>
<pre>sum = 885573821</pre>
<p>To make things worse, other machines would produce <em>different numbers every time you run the program.</em></p>

<p>by getting the files from the google drive, do you mean copy and paste those files into whatever environment you're working in? I am confused on how to use these google drive files when it comes to compiling in the CAEN/Linux environment.... (I'm connecting on a Mac via Terminal)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes just download them from the google drive site and paste them in whatever directory you plan on using. As for using SSH I'm not sure if you can get to the google drive site but you can easily just get on an actual CAEN computer at some point and quickly download all the files and put them in the correct directory, then you can do the rest using SSH.</p>
<p>Sorry about not knowing about SSH but I usually just use VNC or more often just go to a computer lab.</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the files we provide you just need to make sure they are in the same directory as your other project files, and get to that directory in the terminal. Then just use the compile command that was given to you in the spec. </p>

Clang Error</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You need it to be</p>

<pre>g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror -O1 p1.cpp io.cpp -o p1</pre>

<p>Also double check that you are in the directory that your files are stored in.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You must include the '-o' flag in your command before 'p1':</p>

<p>g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror -O1 p1.cpp io.cpp <strong>-o</strong> p1</p>

<p>'-o' is a flag that tells the compiler to output the program into whichever file you supply after the flag (in this case, 'p1'). If the file isn't already created, it will create a new file with the supplied name.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The compiler will overwrite the file you give if it exists (in this example, whatever is in 'p1' will be overwritten). So be careful which filename you supply after the flag.  </p>

<p>I did not need the cmath library.</p>

<p>Hint: use casting.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>At your OWN DISCRETION, you can try submitting a p1.cpp file that has #include &lt;cmath&gt; to the autograder for project1(https://g280-1.eecs.umich.edu/appl/view_proj.php?proj_id=F14P1) to  see if it works. However, there exists a likely possibility that the compiler might not be able to find the cmath library. The cmath library isn't necessary to solve this problem, though.</p>
<p>1+ for casting.(That is how I proceeded.)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>ok thanks for the help!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Bump... I'd like to know if we are allowed to use cmath as well.  Can an instructor let us know if thats allowed?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Do you have a base case for which the loop can exit? I.e. if the number is an integer within the given parameters, exit while loop. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I did the checks before I went into the loop. Basically if you failed any of the required conditions, then don't even bother going any further.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I feel like I've tried all of that and one small thing keeps going wrong every time, unfortunately.  It's getting pretty frustrating especially since I know how to do the rest of the project.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I can't help you without more details, but you could perhaps try a do-while loop - then you get the user's parameters at least once, and the while loop will only execute if the user inputs non-integer years. If all is good, then the while loop doesn't execute. Does that make sense?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I was able to figure it out, made some silly mistakes.  Thank you for the help, everyone!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thank you for suggesting casting.  I used it and it appears to work except that I have been using a while loop that, for some reason, creates an infinite loop in which it keeps running the GetParam function despite correct input.</p></TEXT>

What programs can we use?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think the thing is you can use whatever programs you want, but it would be your responsibility to ensure that your code works on the CAEN Linux system. You can access CAEN Linux from your laptop using this link: http://caen.engin.umich.edu/connect/vnc</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah that's what I was trying to say. Like you can use a different system if you wanted to as long as it works with Linux. I have not tried it myself to see if things will work out but if it does then it works.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, you definitely can, as long as you check for differences. I wrote my project in XCode first, then tested it in the Linux environment to make sure it compiled and did everything I wanted it to do. The key is making sure that you're responsible for any differences across platforms.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>sorry if this is a silly question but how does using Linux differ if I have a mac? Can I still use Xcode and then check if the program works on the linux environment?</p>

fracyears error on autograder</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>They basically have some test case where they put in a non-integer year input to see if your code accounts for that. If you failed it, that means your code failed to account for that condition.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think they probably did a "stress test" where they somehow put in some ridiculously long input. I would assume 100 years or something like that, but I'm not sure.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is there anything we can realistically do to fix this? At least for my code, the failing long case results in an expected .16 and a resulting .17--perhaps a simple rounding error, but the code responsible is in io.cpp which we aren't to touch.</p>
<p>In any case, it passes the other 5 tests, so it doesn't seem to be some fundamental logic error.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>I asked Prof Deorio about this today and he said don't worry about that. Basically this new autograder was inherited from 281 and they care about efficiency there. But for the purposes of this class it's nothing to be concerned about.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have noticed that a few of my numbers always differ in the hundredths place when compared to the test case. When I do calculations for the first month's interest, (100 * (0.05 / 12 ) ), I get a number that is 0.41666666...., but the output for the interest is 0.41, so the trailing 6's need to be truncated. However, for other numbers, I have noticed that rounding gave me the correct hundredths place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Which one should I stick to? Is the correct output possible by using only one?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Truncate or round?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I just let it do what it chooses to do. Didn't have to specifically tell it to do either of those.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Don't worry about truncating or rounding, just send PrintMonthlyData your entire double, and it will take care of the rest for you. If you are having further issues, you may want to rethink how you calculate some of your numbers.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>There should be no rounding errors in your program. In other words, if your program is correct, PrintMonthlyData will not introduce a rounding error. If you have rounding errors, it means that you are calculating something slightly incorrectly.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I seem to be having the same issue and can't figure out why my numbers are being rounded how they are. When I cout the interest on it's own I get the right answer, but when I use the given PrintMonthlyData it is rounding my numbers incorrectly. I know we are not supposed to change PrintMonthlyData, so what's the best way to go about fixing this?</p></TEXT>

How to run my code in CAEN Linux</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sooooo it sounds like your issue is that you're running the command given in Windows Command Prompt, and not in a Linux shell. The CAEN computers run both Windows and Linux, so you need to restart the computer to switch operating systems. As for a more detailed step-by-step process to use a Linux shell, I would recommend coming in to office hours, as it's much easier to walk through rather than explain.</p></TEXT>

<p>Maybe this doesn't apply to this first project, but for later projects if we get all "pass" does that mean we are completely correct? Or will even more test cases be tested beyond what the autograder does?</p></TEXT>

Question about the autograder</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From the autograder email: "Please keep in mind that the autograder does not assign grades.  Project grades also take style, efficiency, and other deliverables into account.  Test cases used for grading may be completely different than those used to evaluate trial submissions."</p>

<p>So even if you've passed the autograder, you're not guaranteed to be completely correct - style-wise, efficiency-wise, or test case-wise. </p>

<p>------<br /><br /></p>
<p>For p1 I think they are pretty lenient, but for future projects they only let you have access to the simple test cases and the autograder feedback would tell you if you pass those. They will run your code against mean test cases that you will never have access to for later projects.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Right - test cases used for grading may not even be the same as the tests the autograder uses, so no guarantees.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So what does the 6/6 signify? Is the project actually out of more than just 6 points? or by getting a 6/6 on the auto grader are you guaranteed at least 6 points on your real grade?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So if we got a 6/6 on the autograder, this does not guarantee full credit for "functional correctness"? </p></TEXT>

<p>Could someone please explain this to me from the Project 1 direction sheet?</p>

Program Compilation Question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When you're in Linux, you type that verbatim into the command line. If it doesn't compile using that command in Linux, then the autograder won't take it.</p>

<p>*** Also, keep in mind that the direction sheet is using a dash (–) instead of the correct hyphen (-) for the -O2 flag. I could not get it to work when I copy and pasted the command, so make sure to make that quick change.</p></TEXT>

<p>Even if you are developing in Xcode, you should be sure to test your program on the CAEN Linux environment. You can access CAEN either using scp and ssh (command line programs available on your mac) or by downloading the VNC client (http://caen.engin.umich.edu/connect/vnc). Once your program is on a CEN Linux computer, you should compile it at the command line using the line you quoted and then try running it on the test case we provided and others you think of yourself.</p></TEXT>

Partnership question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I took 280 in the winter and did not pass.  I had difficulty.  Even with a lot of effort, I did not do well with the programs and did not complete some of the programs.  </p>

<p>I plan on this semester being different, but I wanted to ask a question about partnerships.  Is there any restriction on me partnering with anyone, being that i finished the course previously, yet failed?  I heard some individuals say that I may be limited to partnering with certain individuals because I am repeating the course. </p>

<p>Is this accurate ?  I looked through the syllabus and did not see anything that I saw that would limit my choice, but I wanted to be 100% clear.  Last semester, I learned a a lot from collaborating, but I do not want to get me or someone else in trouble. </p>

<p>Found 400 tokens in source.<br />if this number significantly exceeds the average reported for all students,<br /> your source code is too bloated and needs to be reduced in size.</p>

<p>I got this message in the autograder, and I'm not sure what exactly tokens means, nor how this corresponds to the average reported for all students. If someone could explain this for me, I would greatly appreciate it.</p></TEXT>

Tokens in Source</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The autograder for this semester is taken from EECS 281 so it has a lot of extra stuff it tells you. Tokens are the smallest element in the code that is meaningful to the compiler, basically keywords, variables, literals, operators, and punctuation (semicolons). The token count is essentially just one way of measuring how long you code is. I wouldn't worry about the number of tokens unless it is significantly bigger than the average. That could indicate that you have a lot of extraneous things in your code that you should consider getting rid of to make your code look nicer, remember you are being graded on good code style as well of functionality!</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>By an unfortunate coincidence, it turns out that a common mistake in the computational procedure for project 1 leads to numbers for the example given in the spec that are very close to the correct ones (off by a few hundredths). Traditionally this has caused a bit of confusion as to whether it could just be a rounding issue, but it does actually mean there is a conceptual mistake in the way your code does the calculations.</p>

<p>I actually did the computations by hand, and the last interest value should be .42 rather than .41 which is shown on the example, and consequently the rest of my interest values do not match up either. Is the example just off by a little?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's possible you did the calculations wrong by hand too if you just used the same algorithm your code used. The error is in the method used to get the numbers, not the precision of the tools used to calculate them.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Here's an example walkthrough of the calculations.</p>

<p>You want to start with the formula given in the project specification for calculating the "previous" month's balance (B) from the "current" one (B').</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align:center">B = (B'+P)/(1+r/12)</p>

<p>For example, if we start at the end of the loan and work backwards, that means we plug in 0 for B' (and P=100, r=0.05).</p>

<p style="text-align:center">B = (<strong>0</strong>+100)/(1+0.05/12)<br />B = 99.585 ~= 99.59</p>

<p>Because the principal is the amount paid toward the actual balance each month, we can just compute it as the change in balance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Pr = B - B'<br />Pr = 99.59 - 0 = 99.59</p>

<p>And the interest is just the rest of the monthly payment that didn't go toward the balance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">I = P - Pr</p>
<p style="text-align:center">I = 100 - 99.59 = 0.41</p>

<p>To continue for each month, just repeat with 99.59 as the new B' and so on.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
So are we supposed to round to the hundredths place, or does the autograder account for it?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You don't need to do any rounding, just pass the unrounded results of your computations to <tt>PrintMonthlyData</tt>.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you are having this issue, check to make sure you're doing the interest calculations correctly, working backward from a paid off (zero) balance to the initial balance of a loan that would be able to be paid off in the specified number of years at the specified interest rate. You can (should) use the equation given in the assignment for this and just solve for the variable you want (B' is the balance after a payment, but we want to actually solve for and find B because we're working backward). </p>
<p><br />If your code does the correct computation, the rounding works out and your result will match the example given.</p></TEXT>

<p>It sounds like there's some kind of loop in your program or an error that's making it run too long (runtime budget of 1.000 sec means that it should be able to run in under that time).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
So I think this either means that your output file is too long for the autograder to handle, or you're not outputting things correctly such that the autograder expects to read a certain number of lines, but there are fewer than expected. Given the error I'd think it's more likely that you're somehow producing a very large file. I'd check for infinite loops with different test cases that you write yourself.</TEXT>

<p>Sorry if this is a dumb question. How do I calculate the initial balance, or the total loan amount, given the parameters? Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
How to Calculate Loan?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I can't give you straight up answers to your questions, but here are a few hints:</p>

<ul><li>Since you're going backwards - starting at the final month of the loan, rather than the first month - then your outstanding balance after the final payment must be zero.</li><li>In the project spec, there is a formula under the section "Calculating Interest". This formula will be useful, but you might have to do a little algebra to use it properly. Just note that this formula contains both B (the outstanding balance at the beginning of the month) and B' (the outstanding balance at the beginning of the next month). So here you have two variables that you can use to calculate your financials from month to month. </li><li>As pointed out in @23, interest = balance * (rate/12). </li></ul>

<p>I hope that helps! Just remember, you're starting at the <em>end</em> of the loan, not the beginning, which should guide your calculations.</p></TEXT>

<p>I think they don't care whether users enter 10.0 or 10.00, as long as users don't enter 10.1 or 10.03... some thing like that. So if the user enter the invalid number (10.03), consider how to use division to tell the difference between 10 and 10.03 ...</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p><strong>If anyone think use division is not a good way to solve the problem (or is problematic) ... please tell me. Thanks ...</strong></p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks for the help, I ended up doing it using the floor function, but I see how you could use division.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I used the floor function as well.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Another way to do it without using cmath is casting - you can cast the user's input to the appropriate type, and compare from there.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't want to make this more complicated than it is, but in specs it says: </p>

<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>If the user enters something other than an integer number of years, call GetParam again with the same prompt/limits.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong></strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left">As far as I understand this implies that the input can as well be non-numeric character as well. Correct me if I am wrong but I don't think casting or floor would be correct approaches in this case.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the file the instructor have exclude this situation. It says you can assume only numeric value will be entered. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No, the project spec states at the end that "you do not need to handle any erroneous input - for example, a user who types "foo" instead of "0.05". So non-numeric characters are not an issue in this case.</p></TEXT>

<p>Thanks, that makes the code shorter. I don't usually read hints as they are useless most of time. :)</p></TEXT>

<p>What would happen if you put a double into a modulus operation though? Doesn't it only accept ints?</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>There must be some error in your logic.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That probably means that your while statement is missing a condition in which the loop can exit once fulfilled - i.e. you need something like "while the user doesn't input an appropriate number of years, keep asking. Otherwise, exit and move on."</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I didn't use the floor function, but I guess with the floor function, you can compare the number before and after, if it's a valid number, they should have the same value, and you can leave the loop.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't think you should use floor. What if someone enters say 5.0?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Honestly casting may be easier. Compare your input to your input casted. If they are the same, good.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think it doesn't matter it's 5 or 5.0. It should not ask user to type in again if they types 5.0. </p>
<p>Because 0 won't mess up the calculation while numbers other then 0 (5.1,5.2) will.</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>True. Thinking the function definitions, you are right. There is not really a clear way to handle the case I pointed above anyway. But it should have been considered, because technically 5.0 is still not an integer and the specs say that years should be an integer. Oh well...</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Long test Case</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The useful information here is that your code failed the test case called "long" and that your output differed from the correct answer somewhere on line 4. The "long" test case gives a very large number of years. Try running your code on such an instance and check whether line 4 makes sense.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would test both. Make sure that your program outputs the correct answer when you give it exactly 100 years, and make sure that it rejects any time over 100 years, even if it's something like 100.1 years.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is there any more information about test case long? While I understand that it's a "very large number of years," the years can't exceed 100 or else the specs of the GetParam will simply ignore it and call it again, due to the specs saying that:</p>
<p>"years of the loan (between 1 and 100, inclusive; must be an integer)."</p>

<p>Does a very large number of years mean over 100 or at 100?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Without seeing any more information, it's almost impossible to figure out what your exact issue is. If you're getting the same autograder output, the only thing you know is that you produced the wrong output for a test case with a large input number of years. I would suggest going to office hours if you cannot figure out what the issue is.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>The question I have regards an uncertainty I perceive in the project specification. On page 2 it says:</p>

<p>"Note that you must do a small amount of additional error checking on the "years" input. If the user enters something other than an integer number of years, call GetParam again with the same prompt/limits."</p>

<p>Then it says: </p>
<p>"You do not need to handle any erroneous input---for example, a user who types "foo" instead of "0.05". You may assume that we will always supply numbers when they are expected, but that the numbers might be outside the allowable range. "</p>

<p>According to the io.cpp source file that range error checking is already done for us, so really the only error checking we need to do is the term of the loan being a whole number. Is that correct?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Project Spec Clarification: Input error checking</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're right - you don't need to worry about non-numeric input (like words instead of numbers), but you still need to make sure that the number of years entered by the user is an integer. For example, the user could enter 1.5, which is between the allowable range of 1 and 100 years, but this isn't acceptable because it's not an integer.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I didn't do it and I passed the test cases. So I don't think they will do a test case like that.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Do we need to account for if the user enters 100.453, for example, for the loan amount? Since it's money it should only be to the hundredths place...</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Read the spec. "If the user enters something other than an integer number of years, call GetParam again with the same prompt/limits. "</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So if the user enters 1.5 for years we need to call GetParam again? Or do we just truncate the decimal?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I am wondering how we turn our projects in.  Once we submit it into the auto grader will you be sent the most recent version? Or is there another place we need to submit it?</p></TEXT>

<p>Once the autograder has your submission, it will typically check to make sure that your project compiles. You should receive an email confirmation. As long as the autograder has your submission, you should be all set. It's worth noting that the autograder confirmation does not tell you if your code actually runs correctly - i.e. it's up to you to test it thoroughly.</p>

<p>NOTE: There may(?) be a change this semester in the way that project-submissions are done versus previous semesters. If that is the case, we will make an announcement.</p></TEXT>

<p>In the case of GetParam on duration of the loans, in years, should the program ask for a re-do if the input has a decimal?</p>

<p>For instance, if someone inputs: 1.0,</p>

<p>should the program ask for the parameter again, or should it accept the answer, since technically, 1.0 is a whole number and could be considered an integer?</p></TEXT>

Functions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
The latter. I think they give you the libraries so you don't have to write ones that do the same task as PrintHeader() etc.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you look at the files that were given to you, mainly io.cpp you will find that the functions are already written and you just need to call them at the appropriate times in your p1.cpp file.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend looking at all the code we give you for projects before you start coding yourself and make sure you understand exactly what each function does and more importantly understanding how they work.</p></TEXT>

<p>Unless an instructor further adds to the project specifications, the answer is most likely no. They only state that error checking has to be done on the "years" input, nothing else- they intentionally <em>didn't</em> mention doing any similar sort of error checking on the other two inputs, probably to simplify the overall project.<br /><br />However, this is still just assuming what the instructors want, but hope this helps the stress a bit while waiting for the instructors.</p>

<p>Also - just saw this after writing the last two chunks of text - the following is specifically said in the "Notes and Hints" at the end:</p>
<p>"You do not need to handle any erroneous input"</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Magic Numbers</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'd assume yes, since we got points off for them in 183</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe magic numbers refers to using numbers in your code without indicating what those numbers mean. So, for example, a piece of code using magic numbers would be something like the following:</p>

<pre>double circumference(int r){
    double c = 2*3.1415926535*r;
    return r;
}</pre>
<p>as opposed to this:</p>
<pre>double correct_circumference(int r){
    double pi = 3.141592535;
    double c = 2*pi*r;
    return c;
}</pre>
<p>The second version of code is much more understandable and much easier to change in the future, especially if you have code like the former in multiple places.</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm curious to know: what are magic numbers? Never heard of them before. Clarification would help.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When I took 280, I just used year * 12, and I don't think I got points off for it. The circumference function was a very simple example. The "magic" part in "magic number" refers to numbers that someone else reading you code would not understand and would not be able to figure out where it came from. It's pretty common knowledge that there are 12 months in a year, so I'd leave it as 12.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
What about the limits for user input?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
The limits would not be considered "magic numbers" because anyone who reads the specs would know where they came from. Magic numbers refer to numbers that any other person who read your code would not understand. It also refers to numbers that are universal constants, like pi or any of the constants used in all those physics equations no one remembers. Numbers like these have more meaning for the program when you name them. In the example above, it makes more sense to say the circumference is "2*pi*r" as opposed to "2*3.1415926535*r."

<p>Magic numbers are those numbers that leave people saying "where the heck did that equation come from?!?!" If it is explained through comments, then anyone reading your code knows where those numbers came from. Additionally, universal constants are usually declared as variables, just because it's nicer to look at and so that if you decide to change the precision of said universal constant later, you can do so in one place as opposed to many.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is a number considered a magic number if It's usage is explained through comments ? Or does any presence of a random number make it magic? For example if you use to the number straight up rather than declaring it as a variable or constant and then using it?</p>

<p>Got it.  Thanks a lot!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think the problem is with how you are calculating the principal and interest. I used the B = (B` +  P) / (1 + r / 12) equation and got the right numbers. The only difference was how I got my principal and interest values.</p>

<p>I would suggest you rethink how you are calculating those numbers.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's not just the principal and interest numbers, though. My method for calculating the balance (the rightmost column) uses only the monthly payment variable, the interest rate variable (the two of which the user enters beforehand and which aren't altered), and the previous value of the balance (B` in the equation), and then stores it back into balance for the next month. At no time does the code for determining the next month's balance use the values stored in the principal and interest variables. But some of my balance outputs are <em>still</em> coming out one off at the hundreths place when compared to the example output in project1.pdf.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Would you recumbent finding the new balance then subtracting the old balance to find the next principal? As of right now I'm trying to add the new principal to the existing balance and i am running into ordering problems</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>recommend*</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes. For more explanation on the equations to use, refer to <a href="https://www.piazza.com/class/hyrdt7uykox4mt?cid=94" target="_blank">@94</a>. James's explanation was excellent. If you need more explanation, I would suggest going to office hours.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I used the equation B = (B` +  P) / (1 + r / 12) exactly to figure out the balance for the month after the first (which is actually the last) month. Because we're calculating these numbers backwards (meaning from month 12 to month 1, instead of the other way around), B` is the balance for month 12, and B is the balance for month 11.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After that, I subtract the current balance (the one for month 11) from the previous balance (the one for month 12) to get month 11's principal. Finally, I subtract that principle amount from the monthly payment amount to get the current (month 11) interest rate. I repeat this for the remaining months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I use the third equation <em>exactly</em> but my output still differs by one in a few of the hundredths places. What am I doing wrong?</p></TEXT>

<p>Project 1 is graded completely based on what the autograder decides.</p>

<p>For future projects, the autograder would only be something like 80-90% of your grade. The rest of the points will be based on style, which is graded by person. And then I doubt they are going to have the time to go through everyone's autograder results to figure out how big or small the issues were.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ah, so the 6 test cases (years, rate, payment, long, fracyears, example) accounts for 100% of this project grade?</p>
<p><br />I see, I assumed it meant that there was extra grading going on in the background and that the test cases were only a small portion of the grade. Thanks so much!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
This is actually not correct. A 6/6 on the autograder feedback does not necessarily mean that you will pass all the test cases that the autograder runs to determine your final grade. They may be entirely different test cases, or there may be some that are the same. Additionally, if the results of running your code with our test cases differs at all from the results from running the solution with the test cases, even if the difference is only a new line character, it will be marked as incorrect. There are just too many of you for us to hand grade the results of the test cases, which is why we have the autograder. What Brian means when he says that the autograder accounts for 100% of your grade is that there is not a hand grading portion, *not* that the 6 test cases are the only tests we're running to determine your final grade. Additionally, there actually is a hand grading portion, so the above statement that autograder results is 100% of your grade is incorrect.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I ran the test1 with the output1 and used diff, and the terminal didn't show me anything. Does that mean I passed this test case?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No, they might have more tricky test cases in real grading. ( I guess some corner situation )</p>
<p>The test1 is provided just for you to make sure that at least you got the calculation right.  But they still test other things like invalid input etc... </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>^^ Yes, you passed that specific test case. But they don't release any more to you. You have to figure out your own.</p>

<p>And then the fact that your p1 grade is completely autograder based was what I believed had been true in past semesters. But since they are now using a new autograder that gives you more feedback than the old one, I guess things may change to make up for the new advantages we get.</p>

<p>Plus for future projects the autograder only gives you feedback for some test cases when you are allowed to submit. And then when they do the actual grading, they add on more complicated test cases to the autograder to give you your grade. Then they have a hand grading portion.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So I'm supposed to have a:</p>

<pre>cout &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
<p>then at the end of my code? it seems superfluous to have that entire line of just white space--and it's hard to tell whether or not I will get penalized for it since the autograder "does not assign grades", only giving feedback to 6 test cases.</p>

<p>Thanks though!</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Getting started?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>To me there are two main parts to the project: getting the user's parameters, then calculating and spitting out all the financials. In the former, use GetParam() to obtain the parameters within the bounds set in the spec; on top of that make sure to do a bit of error checking to ensure that the user's years entered are an integer within the bounds.</p>

<p>The next part is calculating the loan. You're given a formula to work with in the spec: it contains both B and B' so you can go about calculating loan balances for both this month and the next month. But note above all that the project is set up so that you start from the <em>end</em> of the loan, rather than the beginning. At the end of the loan, as pointed out in the last hints of the project spec, the final outstanding balance MUST be zero - so you know that you're going to start from zero and work your way up so that you can eventually reach the first month of the loan. With a bit of algebra, you can rearrange the formula given to you and calculate your loan backwards, starting from 0.</p>

<p>I hope that helps and sort of addresses the questions that you're asking!! Also, you could check out @38, which contains more or less the same ideas as above.</p></TEXT>

<p>To me there are two main parts to the project: getting the user's parameters, then calculating and spitting out all the financials. In the former, use GetParam() to obtain the parameters within the bounds set in the spec; on top of that make sure to do a bit of error checking to ensure that the user's years entered are an integer within the bounds.</p>

<p>The next part is calculating the loan. You're given a formula to work with in the spec: it contains both B and B' so you can go about calculating loan balances for both this month and the next month.

<p>Sorry if this is a dumb question, but on the spec the example shows:</p>

<pre>Month   Principal        Interest

12          99.59            0.41

<div>
<pre>  Balance
---------
    99.59
   198.76
   297.52
   395.87
   493.81

</div>

<p>So how come the balance starts at 99.59 and not 100? Also I don't understand what it means when it says that the monthly payment is first used to pay off the interest, and then the remainder is applied to the principal.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Can't figure out the finance part</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think you're confusing the loan balance with the monthly payment. The monthly payment is how much one can afford to pay per month - a number given by the user. On the other hand, balance is calculated by the program - from the bottom up, it's the total amount of loan the user can afford to take out. The balance starts at 99.59 in this case because in the very last month of the loan, given the user's parameters, the loan balance is 99.59. </p>

<p>Notice that for every month, you're paying a total of 100 dollars, either toward paying off interest or to the principal (which, as the spec states, "is used to reduce the outstanding balance on the loan"). You might want to take a look at the financials from month to month and see how they're related. I don't think I can go too in detail, but I hope that gives you some ideas!</p></TEXT>

<p>If the user enters a double are we supposed to just round/floor/cast to an int or do we need a loop to call Getparam again until they get it right?

Confused about Year Reading</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>1.NO, you don't just round it. You need to call Getparam until they get it right. But you don't need to exclude numbers like 5.0, 5.00 since they are practically integer. The point about excluding "double" is to avoid numbers like 5.1, 5.2 --- which will mess up the month calculation.</p>

<p>2.Since Getparam will return the number user entered, you just check if the number it returns a valid number. (use it as the loop condition part). If not, ask the user to type in again. (you don't need to modify the function, you just utilize the return value)</p>

<p>    </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The specifications say that the years input must be an integer -- does this mean that we must declare the years input as an int?  Or is this direction only referring to the fact that we must call GetParam() again if the user tries to enter a double in (and there is no restriction on the type for the years variable)? </p>

<p>I had been under the assumption that we were able to declare it as a double at least, but I wanted to make sure I'm not misunderstanding anything.  Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Does it matter what we declare the years variable as?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I went back and try to see what will happen if I declare <strong>year</strong> as  <strong>int</strong>. </p>

<p>So the thing is, if you declare your <strong>year</strong> in <strong>int</strong>, when you pass the result of the Getpram function to your year, which is a double value, it does implicit typecasting. (i.e. if the return value is 5.5, your <strong>year </strong>will only store the 5 part, cut the .5 out ).</p>
<p>Can you see the problem here? In this case you will never be able to tell if the user type in a invalid double value ( 5.5 ), since you are always left with a "correct" int value.</p>

<p>So I suggest declare it as double. </p></TEXT>

<p>As a student who was briefly enrolled in 280 previously, I had two quick policy questions. Firstly, I was wondering if I am allowed to use code from projects that I had previously submitted when I was enrolled and, if not, how I should go about trying to avoid unintentionally plagiarizing myself. Secondly I was wondering if I would be allowed to partner with people for projects that occurred after I previously dropped the course. Thank you all in advance for any help you might be able to provide.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
questions about previous enrollment</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Our official response is that you are better off starting from scratch. That way, you get more out of the project and are better prepared for exams and later projects. That said...</p>

<p>For the first question: If the original code was your <em>and yours alone </em>(i.e. not you and a partner), then yes you may reuse it here if you are not working with a partner. As an extra safeguard, maybe consider placing a comment at the top of the code files explaining that you are reusing your own code.</p>
<p>Just to be clear... If you're asking: "I have my own code from a previous semester, am I allowed to use it this semester when I go to partner with someone else?" In that case, I believe the answer is <em>no</em>, but Prof. DeOrio has the final say on that.</p>

<p>For the second question, let me make sure I understand. Suppose you dropped after project 2 (i.e. you never did project 3). Are you asking if it is alright for you to partner with someone for project 3 and beyond? If that is the question, then yes you can do that.</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>You're going to want to run it in Terminal: Applications (in the top toolbar) --&gt; System Tools --&gt; Terminal. There you can use the g++ compiler; remember to compile from the specific directory in which your files are located. Check out @14: it has the command you should type into the terminal to get the files you need. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can do it a couple of ways. The way I suggested was from the virtual desktop. If you've got a Mac, a fast and easy way to connect to CAEN is through SSH: type this into your terminal: ssh uniqname@login.engin.umich.edu. But if you've already got a virtual desktop up, you can just go to Applications, System Tools, and click on Terminal!</p>

<p>I am writing my code in the same directory as io.cpp but how do I get the information from io.cpp to work together with the code I write? Do I include it at the top of my code?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Adding the io.cpp file to my code</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Make sure the io.h header file is in the same directory; #include "io.h" at the top of your p1.cpp file. Then you're including the header file for io.cpp in your code, in effect linking the files together.</p></TEXT>

<p>I have a working program that I am trying to compile in CAEN Linux environment though remote access. When I try to compile I get this warning:</p>

<p>p1.cpp:46: error: 'GetParam was not declared in this scope'</p>

<p>and same error for the other two functions as well. So, correct me if I am wrong but I thought the command:</p>

<p>g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror –O1 p1.cpp io.cpp -o p1</p>

<p>Was supposed to combine p1.cpp and io.cpp into a single execitable named p1, despite this, am I supposed to declare functions that are defined in io.cpp in p1.cpp as well? </p>

<p>Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Function not declared in p1.cpp scope</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>GetParam() is declared in io.h and defined in io.cpp; it is linked to p1.cpp through the header file io.h. Did you #include io.h in your p1.cpp, and is io.h in the same directory as your other files?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I suppose; then there would be no need for io.cpp either. You'd just have everything - your main function, plus all other functions such as GetParam - in one file.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks, that's what I thought too. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You don't have to put io.cpp's functions inside of the p1.cpp because of how the compile code works.</p>

<pre>g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror –O1 p1.cpp io.cpp -o p1</pre>
<p>Because you're compiling not only p1.cpp but <em>also </em>io.cpp, you don't do anything but #include io.h and call the io.cpp files. The actual guts of the io.cpp functions shouldn't be in p1.cpp, as they entire file of io.cpp is compiled with p1.cpp.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think you got it wrong. I meant just declaring functions inside p1.cpp, not defining them. Obviously then, there would be no point in using io.cpp if the whole content was inside p1.cpp anyway. I asked the hypothetical question because I have seen C programmers declare functions every time they create a separate scope and because the compiler complained about not having declaring functions inside p1.cpp.</p>

<p>But nevermind, not that important anyway.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, I forgot to include io.h, because I originally have written all function definitions inside p1.cpp (only to find out that they were already supplied inside another folder).</p>

<p>Back to the original question, assuming there wasn't an io.h file, for command:</p>

<p>g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror –O1 p1.cpp io.cpp -o p1</p>

<p>to work, I guess I would have to write GetParam(string prompt, double min, double max); etc. Correct?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I seem to be having the same issue I have seen in other comments on here with truncation and rounding. I can't figure out why setprecision in PrintMonthlyData is rounding my numbers. When I cout the interest on it's own I get the right answer, but when I use the given PrintMonthlyData it is rounding my numbers incorrectly. I am only off by one decimal, but no matter what I try, I can't get this decimal to change. I know we are not supposed to change PrintMonthlyData, so what's the best way to go about fixing this?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
rounding error</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hint: you don't need to initialize principal and interest before you enter the loop, if this is what you have been trying to do.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Pay more attention to your calculation. Also, there is nothing wrong with rounding in your example; 99.583 is closer to 99.58 than 99.59. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I tried only initializing balance before entering the loop, but the balance for month 12 still differs. What I did was set balance = P * (1 - r/12), where P is the monthly payment (100 in this case) and r is the interest rate (0.05 in this case). The balance comes out as 99.5833333..., which is rounded down to 99.58 instead of 99.59.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In all likelihood, this isn't a rounding issue. (Although it could be, of course.)  Traditionally, a lot of students have this same question - it turns out that an incorrect application of the formulas for calculating the interest happens to give results pretty close to the correct ones (but still ultimately incorrect) for the example given in the assignment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Check to make sure you're doing the interest calculations correctly, working backward from a paid off (zero) balance to the initial balance of a loan that would be able to be paid off in the specified number of years at the specified interest rate. You can (should) use the equation given in the assignment for this and just solve for the variable you want (B' is the balance after a payment, but we want to actually solve for and find B because we're working backward). <br /><br />If your code does the correct computation, the rounding works out and your result will match the example given.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Which version of the formula are you using?  The most useful one is:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">B = (B'+P)/(1+r/12)</p>
<p style="text-align:center"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">For example, if we start at the end of the loan and work backwards, that means we plug in 0 for B' (and P=100, r=0.05).</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:center">B = (<strong>0</strong>+100)/(1+0.05/12)<br />B = 99.585 ~= 99.59</p>
<p style="text-align:center"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Because the principal is the amount paid toward the actual balance each month, we can just compute it as the change in balance.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:center">Pr = B - B'<br />Pr = 99.59 - 0 = 99.59</p>
<p style="text-align:center"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">And the interest is just the rest of the monthly payment that didn't go toward the balance.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<p style="text-align:center">I = P - Pr</p>
<p style="text-align:center">I = 100 - 99.59 = 0.41</p>
<p style="text-align:center"></p>
<p style="text-align:left">To continue for each month, just repeat with 99.59 as the new B' and so on.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The first formula you showed was the one I was using, but my principal and interest were slightly off from the last formulas you showed. Thanks for explaining that. I appreciate it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Glad it helped :).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This formula works for me for the first month. However, if I apply it to another month (say, month 6) I get the wrong balance. In turn, this messes up my interest, principal, etc.</p>

<p>For example, in month 6, my principal is 97.13 and my balance is 688.48. Plugging this into the given equation, B = (97.13 + 688.48)/(1+.05/12) = 782.35. In the example, month 5 should in stead be 785.21. </p>

<p>I am not sure why the formula is not giving me the proper balance for the next month. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This has happened to me before ;).  The P in the formula stands for the monthly <strong>P</strong>ayment, not the <strong>Pr</strong>incipal.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I am using the formula given in the project file, but still ending up just slightly off by the last decimal point in a few of my numbers. I am not sure what I could be doing wrong when I have just applied the formula given. Any suggestions?</p></TEXT>

<p>I have been able to pass 5/6 of the available test cases, but can not figure out what the issue is with the long test case.</p>

<p>Doing test runs with long time periods (100 years) it seems as though the payments made start off (at month 1) very small and grow towards the entered monthly payment. However, this behavior is also shown in the provided test case on the project1.pdf (the payments decrease down the month listing.)</p>

<p>The fact that I'm passing the other 5 test cases leads me to believe that there isn't an issue with my understanding of the problem, but instead there's something very small that I'm overlooking.</p>

<p>Has anyone else had an issue with passing the long test case initially?</p></TEXT>

Test Case Long Issue</TEXT>

<p>The most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.</p></TEXT>

<p>Long does not check the max. It checks an edge case of 100 years (or another high number of years less than 100).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Are you sure that the payment ever changes? If so, then you have a mistake in your program. Otherwise you are confusing principal with payment. Principal is the amount applied to the debt balance, after interest is taken off from the monthly payment.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think this may be the issue. I was miscalculating the principal.</p>

<p>EDIT: Confirmed. That was the issue. Thanks a ton. It's strange that the calculation I used worked for the other 5 test cases.</p></TEXT>

<p>I think  long  checks to  see if  your <em> max</em> for  years is correct.  If you enter  something like 101 the  program should  stop. </p>

<p>I don't have a ton of experience with this autograder but from past experience I'd guess your program produced a number starting with the digit 9 instead of a number starting with 19, like 90 instead of 1900 or 900 instead of 19. Since there's so much formatting done to our output for this program it would be hard to analyze what exact line and character an error comes from without seeing more than the autograder is showing, but if I were having this problem I'd try and replicate it on my machine by varying the parameters of the loan. The failure occurs on line 4 in the output, which is probably one of the first lines of output following the header. Since this is close to the starting point if you get lucky the error might be obvious.</p></TEXT>

<p>Are you sure about that?

 <TEXT>
<p>I might be way off here, but as far as I know tabs and spaces are different characters in the OS. A lot of editors have an option to use spaces to indent when you press the tab key because some programmers prefer spaces to tab and vice versa. That's kind of tangent to your problem though. Can you copy and paste the line in question (line 29 of p1.cpp?)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Time = GetParam("Please enter the duration of the loan, in years: ", 1, 100);</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>when I copy and pasted that line into notepad I got 78 characters, so it seems like with indentation it could push it past 80 characters. What people usually do to solve this (not sure if there's a specific way we're going to do it in this class) is to start a new line somewhere in the statement and indent the next line to make it clear it follows the half-line. For example, your code could be turned into:</p>
<pre>Time = GetParam(<br />	"Please enter the duration of the loan, in years: ", 1, 100);</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
Time = GetParam("Please enter the duration of the loan, in years: "<br />		, 1, 100);</pre>
<p>or anything in that vein will probably be properly understood. Again, not sure if there's a specific style we'll use in this class but that's a solution I've seen before. You could also store the message in a string variable before you call the GetParam function, like:</p>
<pre>char * message = "Please enter the duration of the loan, in years: ";
Time = GetParam(message, 1, 100);</pre>
<p>I used a c-style string (char * )in the example since you won't need to include any header files to use it, but you could replace that with "string" and get similar results if you include &lt;string&gt;</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That worked </p>
<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>nope just tabs</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Tabs are their own characters and are considered. Try to keep your lines within the 80 character length, it's not a huge problem if one or two lines are over but please try to keep them close, this will be a factor in the style part of the grading.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>the way I figured out how to do this was to calculate the principal,interest, and balance of each month separately, so that means 3 calculations per month which would lead to quite a bit of code. Would it be a good idea to make these three calculations into a function and just call that every time or is there an even more efficient way to approach this problem? Please help!</p></TEXT>

I think Brian flipped the answers for 1 and 2. Comments are always good. For this project, because you don't have partners yet, you don't need any information at the top of the file. We know who submitted it and what section you're in. For future projects, you will need to put some information at the top, I believe.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For the prompts that ask the user to type in information, I tried putting double sets of quotations around the strings but my program only works when I use a single set of quotations.  However, I thought we need both sets because one set is used for the string declaration and the other is used in the string itself.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
prompt arguments</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You have to use escape characters if you are using double quotation, however, there are no quotation marks (") inside the string for this project.</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>Hey, i manually ran my code with the example integers given in the spec and got a table identical to the output in the spec.  I used however I still have  ..__truncated at position __ feedback from the autograder for every case. Can anyone explain?   Thanks !!</p></TEXT>

<p>Try rewriting your code from scratch on a CAEN Linux computer if you initially wrote it using something else. There may be differences between how different platforms interpret something. I remember having that issue before with some other thing.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No need to re-write your code from scratch: just try compiling and running on a CAEN machine, you can debug from there. Have you tried using the command-line program <tt>diff </tt>to compare your output to the sample output? If you are inspecting visually, there might be some small difference you're not spotting.</p></TEXT>

<p>For some reason whenever I try to compile my io.cpp file I get a decent amount of compiling errors even in my io.h which is literally copy pasted from the project1.pdf. I get the errors:</p>

<p>io.h:5: error: expected unqualified-id before ‘double’</p>
<p>io.h:5: error: expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before ‘double’</p>

<p>line 5 in the io.h file is where GetParam is declared</p></TEXT>

Compiling erros</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>did you have #include "io.h" in your p1.cpp file?</p>

<p>Try downloading the io.h file from CTools. I'd guess that the entire io.h file wasn't included in the project1.pdf and you have an incomplete version of it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>did you have #include "io.h" in your p1.cpp file?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
What line exactly are you typing to compile?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>the line I am using is "g++ p1.cpp -o p1"</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>use </p>

<pre>g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror –O1 p1.cpp io.cpp -o p1</pre>
<p>and see if it helps. #include io.h isn't enough because you need to compile io.cpp with it.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>This may be a basic question, but I am still unclear on whether <strong>years </strong>has to be the rigorous definition of an integer such as: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , or whether values such as 1.000, 2.00 are valid as well.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Regarding what is an integer and what isn't</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Values such as 1.0000 and 2.00 are valid. Basically what you should be taking away from the spec is that as long as there are not floating point values the number is valid. </p>

<p>That is to say that: </p>
<p>1.00000 is valid but 1.0000001 is not. </p>

<p>When checking to see if they user input for years is valid you need to keep this differentiation in mind. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I understand how the last equation given in the project file can find you any month's balance based on the balance of the month after it. What I don't understand is how you start the loop then, because I don't know what the initial values would be to start the equation with.</p>

<p>I know balance would be zero (because at the end everything is paid off), and monthly payment and interest rate are constant, but how do we initialize principal? It seems it converges to the monthly payment amount, so I tried starting it off with that and got the slightly different results problem.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Not sure how to start the while loop</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you take a look at the sample output, the very last month is the first line, and month 1 is the last line.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Don't feel bad man.  Evidently I can't read either. I've been fiddling with this for a few days now completely bewildered till I bothered to re-read the spec.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>carefully reading the spec is always the best thing to do first :)<br /><br /></p>
<p>Also I find printing out the specs and writing notes all over them is a very good habit to get into.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Oh wow, I thought that P was principal but it's monthly payment. Nevermind then!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I passed all the test cases But the autograder tells me my brace style is inconsistent on lines 6 and 10 but there is nothing on line 6 and no braces on line 10. Also where a I supposed to type the command line? In the command prompt? I'm using VS.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Command Line and Style</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The "inconsistent brace style" remark is referring to the file io.cpp, so you don't need to worry about it.</p>

<p>And the command prompt is to be typed into terminal so you can compile your program using g++. If you're unclear about using Linux/CAEN, you can check out Resources/Quick References on CTools, or see questions @9 and @29 for more! </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have found that when testing my code with some extreme inputs (such as $1 monthly payment, 1% annual interest, and 1 year of loan; or $99,999.99 monthly payment, 100% interest rate, and 1 year of loan), because my code calculates the table information to several places past the decimal point, some of the numbers in the table, since they are rounded to the hundredths place, are off by 1 cent. This is not a problem with more reasonable test cases: the code outputs the test example given in the prompt correctly and has passed all of the public tests in the autograder. It also does not occur in every extreme test case (e.g., all output seems to be correct when input is $100,000 monthly payment, 100% annual interest, and 1 year of loan).</p>

<p>Is this a calculation/rounding problem that I should be concerned about? If so, is there a way to remedy it?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Extreme Test Cases</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I wouldn't say so. I think this project was more for letting you get used to the Linux environment rather than trying to get at you with extreme test cases.</p></TEXT>

Looks to me like you're prompting in the wrong order. It looks like its expecting you to prompt for the monthly payment and you're prompting the interest rate. As for why you don't get a different diff, are you running it on CAEN?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The test case might give you an invalid payment and expect you to ask for the monthly payment again, where instead your program asks for the interest rate.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Andrew was correct... I erroneously set the minimum payment as 0 instead of 1.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, I performed all tests on the <tt>login.engin.umich.edu</tt> server.</p>

<p>That's what I gleaned from the message as well.  My code</p>
<ol><li>GetParam's monthly interest</li><li>GetParam's interest rate</li><li>GetParam's loan duration</li><li>Checks that we collected an integer value for (3), and if not, prompts again until we do</li></ol></TEXT>

<p>No. That's my "hypothetical beginning of month 13" notation. It's just intended to point out that you're starting from a zero balance and working backward to the original amount of the loan. Sorry for the confusion. :)</p></TEXT>

<p>Good evening,</p>

<p>When I try to run p1.cpp in the linux terminal with the given examples,test cases, and some extreme cases I make myself,  the results come out exactly as they should.</p>

Testing</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sounds like you've already done good testing, but here's just some general ideas:</p>

<ul><li>Normal tests - tests that fits the boundaries, tests that the instructors explicitly gave to you, like the two examples in the spec.</li><li>Borderline tests - 0% interest, 100% interest, but also borderline out-of-range cases like a $100,001 monthly payment.</li><li>"Nonsense" tests - don't type in non-numeric characters as input, as that will not make your program happy, but you can try stuff like a negative interest rate. I'm not too sure what kind of "nonsense" tests would be applicable in this project, really.</li><li>Stress tests - large amounts of years, big numbers, and so on.</li></ul>

<p>In general, look at sections of your code and ask yourself "what could go wrong here?" What's the flow/setup of your program, and how might that go wrong? Also, I'm not sure what you're using to develop, but I know at least XCode has a great debugger to get familiar with - if nothing else to get a really in-depth look at how your program is executing statements. Hopefully you get some ideas from this.</p></TEXT>

Beyond that, you should be able to check without calculating if the output still prints correctly, if the program re-prompts when outside the allowed ranges, and make sure the outputs make sense (the remaining balance should increase as you go back towards the first month of the loan, for instance).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>this may seem like a silly question, but how do I know what the theoretical results of my test cases should be if the program is working correctly? When using very large numbers it gets difficult to calculate by hand what the correct balance should be…is there a way to know?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So I wrote my code in XCode, and it works fine and passed the autograder, however, when I try to use the g++ compiler it says that there is no such file or directory for io.cpp and p1.cpp. Does this mean my code is incorrect for Linux or am I just missing something obvious? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
g++ compiler</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sounds like you may not have the terminal pointed at the directory you mean to be working in. Where are your io.cpp and p1.cpp files, and what directory do you have open in the terminal?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I had the same issue, and the problem ended up being that one of the characters in the compiling command line on the project pdf was incorrect. </p>
<p>It pasted through as "g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror –O1 p1.cpp io.cpp -o p1"; note how the dash in front of "O1" is different than the other dashes. Replacing it with a normal dash may resolve your issue.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Unfortunately it still does not work for mine. Thank you for the suggestion though!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
can you copy and paste the command causing the error?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>-bash-4.1$ g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror -O1 p1.cpp io.cpp -o p1</p>
<p>g++: p1.cpp: No such file or directory</p>
<p>g++: io.cpp: No such file or directory</p>

<p>It looks like you don't actually have the terminal set to the Documents directory. When you open a terminal it typically is working in your home directory. Your files are in the Documents directory, so you can type "cd Documents" to change directory and go there. Then you should be able to compile the files with the command you were using.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>io.cpp and p1.cpp are both in my documents and I opened my documents in terminal as well.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Two quick ways to make sure the files you want are in the directory you're in:</p>
<p>1. Use the <em>ls</em> command and look for the file names in the output, or</p>
<p>2. Use the <em>more</em> command with the name of the file you're looking for; e.g., "more p1.cpp". If it's there, you'll see the file contents; if it's not there, you'll get a "No such file or directory" message. This one is helpful if you're looking in a cluttered directory and don't want to look through all the ls output.</p>

<p>I can calculate the balance at month 12 using a principal of 100 and balance of 0 using the formula</p>

<p>B=(B'+P)/(1+r/12)</p>

<p>and this gives me the correct balance for month 12. However, when I apply the same formula for month 11, using a principal of 99.59 and a balance of 99.59, I get a different balance for month 11 than what is provided.</p>

<p>I don't understand what it's getting at because in each instance that I call GetParam it only has three arguments, as it should, each with the correct type (string, double, double). Could it be a result of a long string value being put in for the string argument? This is really my only thought as to what it could be. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Ask for re-input</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ask for re-input</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe they want us to use doubles for years as the GetParam function returns doubles, and to simplify using the function, we would just use a double. However, that also purposely adds the complication of making sure a double is a whole number.</p>

<p>If you'd like help to figure out exactly how to check if a double is a whole number, feel free to open up a new question. When I did it, I didn't customize the input type at all. A small hint: My way used a do-while loop with the condition being if the double is a whole number.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
I tried it. It worked, but I just used a while loop and it worked even after multiple iterations.  thoughts?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The idea is that years should have double <em>type</em>, but we want to ensure that it only has an integer <em>value.</em></p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
After reading other posts endorsed by instructors, they say that we should declare years as type, double.  However, would that not allow us to reject fraction years as invalid input?  Or is there some way to customize the in input type so that it only accepts something like 1.0 yrs or 3.0 yrs?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My error checking for the loan duration weeds out decimals just fine, but whenever I put a fraction in, it passes the test, only using the numerator for the duration.

 <TEXT>
Fraction inputs for loan duration</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You don't need to worry about this kind of thing. The only additional checking you need to do (once you've called GetParam with the appropriate arguments) is making sure the number of years has an integer value.</p></TEXT>

That sounds possible, but I doubt it's an actual issue with the compiler. The error you're getting is the same you would get if you didn't <pre>#include "io.h"</pre> in  your p1.cpp file.

Unknown Errors</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
It looks like you have a segfault in your program, which could be caused by a lot of things, like accessing a member of an array that doesn't exist. Essentially it means that while your program is syntactically valid, you're doing something that the operating system won't allow.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As Andrew says, a lot of different problems can cause seg faults. The autograder won't give you enough feedback to track down the problem. Did you try running it yourself before submitting to the autograder? Did it crash then? If so, what error messages did it give you? </p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The autograder has been returning the following feedback for me, I'm not quite sure what it means. Although my code works fine, it isn't actually running any of the test cases, just says this:</p>


<p>Build warnings/errors:</p>
<p>cc1plus: warnings being treated as errors</p>
<p>p1.cpp: In function â€˜int main()â€™:</p>
<p>p1.cpp:18: error: â€˜totalBalanceâ€™ may be used uninitialized in this function</p>
<p>make: *** [p1] Error 1</p>

<p>make exited with non-zero exit status.</p>
<p>Be sure to include a Makefile and not to put your </p>
<p>files in any subdirectory/subfolder in your submit.tgz. </p>
<p>If make works locally, check to be sure that you are not relying</p>
<p>on built-in variables/rules by running make -r -R</p>

<p>Total points earned: (0.0 for code) = 0.0 points</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Autograder feedback</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The fix should be what the error message says: that the variable totalBalance has not been initialized in your p1.cpp file but is being used in line 18. Your code may have worked fine if the variable isn't actually performing a function, but the easiest fix is just to initialize it (or remove it if it's inconsequential).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's complaining because you might use totalBalance before you set its value. If it's uninitialized, you don't know what junk data is in there. See what happens if you put some good data in there before you use it.</p>

<p>As an example,</p>
<pre>int * badnum;<br />cout &lt;&lt; *badnum &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
<p>gives me a similar error:</p>
<pre>p1_modified.cpp: In function 'int main()':<br />p1_modified.cpp:29:12: error: 'badnum' is used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=uninitialized]<br />cc1plus: all warnings being treated as errors</pre>
<p>but if I tell it what to store in badnum:</p>
<pre>int * badnum;<br />*badnum = 42;<br />cout &lt;&lt; *badnum &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
<p>the problem is solved.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Abstraction</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the most general sense, abstraction is the process by which we enable ourselves to think about ideas <em>in the abstract</em> without having to worry about all the details of how they are concretely implemented.  Applied in the sense of a programming strategy, let's look at an example from project 1.  The PrintMonthlyData and GetParam functions do conceptually abstract things - they print out a set of data in a certain way and get a parameter from the console, but you don't need to know how they work internally (i.e. peeking at io.cpp) in order to use them effectively.</p>

<p>Throughout the course we'll see tons of different examples of abstraction being used to enable us to do much more complex things than we would be able to if we had to worry about all the individual details at the same time.  Some things that come to mind are functions (procedural abstraction), abstract data types, recursion (sort of), object-oriented programming, etc.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hey everyone. I can't find anyone else with this issue, but for some reason I keep getting this error:</p>

<pre> syntax error near unexpected token `('</pre>
<p>no matter what program I run, be it project 1 or a simple hello world. I can compile just fine, but the error pops up when it tries to run. I don't have any   '   characters in the code, nor do I have single quotation marks. It also only shows up for the first instance of parentheses, typically the first function.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why it can't recognize a parentheses. I have a feeling there's something obvious I'm missing.</p>

<p>This is all in Red Hat, through the VNC program (from a Windows 7 machine). I'm working in gedit and using the command line given in the spec. I have the three include statements. I'm working in the bash shell.</p>
<p>Do I need to use a different editor, or change the shell, or make sure everything is encoded the same way?</p>

<p>UPDATE: here's the HelloWorld program I tried to run.</p>

<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;<br />using namespace std;
int main()<br />{<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!";<br /> return 0;<br />}</pre>

<pre> syntax error near unexpected token `('</pre>
<p>no matter what program I run, be it project 1 or a simple hello world. I can compile just fine, but the error pops up when it tries to run. I don't have any   '   characters in the code, nor do I have single quotation marks. It also only shows up for the first instance of parentheses, typically the first function.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why it can't recognize a parentheses. I have a feeling there's something obvious I'm missing.</p>

<p>This is all in Red Hat, through the VNC program. I'm working in gedit and using the command line given in the spec. I have the three include statements. I'm working in the bash shell.</p>
<p>Do I need to use a different editor, or change the shell, or make sure everything is encoded the same way?</p></TEXT>

<p>Can you post a hello world program that causes the error?<br /><br />Seeing your code, you're trying to run the .cpp file not the executable produced by the compiler. If you compile that program with:</p>
<pre>g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror -O1 helloworld.cpp -o helloworld</pre>
<p>then to run it you want to type ./helloworld, not ./helloworld.cpp</p></TEXT>

<p>why is the outstanding balance in month 12 in the table in the spec not 0?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
table in spec</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Because the table's set up to show you every month that you have an outstanding balance. If there were a thirteenth month - the first month after the end of your year-long loan - then you'd have an outstanding balance of 0, meaning that you have nothing left to pay.</p>

<p>Another way to look at is: in the first month, you take out a loan of $1168.12. That's your outstanding balance for that first month. From there, the principal is applied to reduce the loan balance each month. In the final month, you have an outstanding balance of $99.59, and your principal of $99.59 pays it off perfectly so that next month your outstanding balance is 0.</p>

<p>Edit: right, when I say principal I mean the part of the monthly payment that goes toward reducing the outstanding balance on the loan. Part of your monthly $100 goes toward interest, and the other part toward the loan. </p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Nicely put, Tara. I'll just add that I think you meant "From there, the <em>payment</em> is applied." Several people have gotten payment (the amount you pay off each month) and principal (the amount of loan balance left each month) mixed up.</p></TEXT>

<p>I was looking at the final slide in today's lecture regarding resource costs of iteration and recursion, and I wasn't able to draw any specific conclusion.</p>

<p>What I did find was that</p>
<ul><li>both cases involve x multiplications</li><li>the recursive case involves (x+1) stack frames and (x+1) integers</li><li>the iterative case involves (x+1) comparisons, x decrements, one stack frame, and 2 integers</li></ul>

<p>Did anyone find anything different, and is there any way to verify from this information that one algorithm is superior in regard to resource management? If I had to guess, it seems like iteration would be more efficient when x is sufficiently large because of the number of variables and stack frames that would have to be utilized in the recursive case. Any other thoughts?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Recursion vs Iteration Resource Costs</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So technically recursion uses more memory than the iterative version because there are multiple stack frames, however if they both have the same run general run time. That is if you coded both versions correctly. But just wait for the future recursion lectures and more recursion cool stuff will be explained.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That being said sometimes the recursive method just makes more sense than the iterative version, (spoilers) you will see this occur in project 2 in a few days!!! And some people even prefer the recursive method because they think it looks pretty and elegant.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Just to clarify you are allowed to use math.h</p>

<p>Also if you got a a 6/6 on the autograder that doesn't always mean you will get a 100% on the final grade for the project. Like Kevin said style is taken into account, but it is not a major part of your grade, it's usually only 10% of the final grade.</p>

<p>HOWEVER when we run your code to get the final grade we will have more test cases that weren't on the autograder you used to submit. So you should still account for extra stuff in your program and if you think you did enough testing you should test your code some more.</p>

<p>moral of the story is always test your code then test it some more.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm not exactly sure how to check for an integer value for years if I cannot use the &lt;math.h&gt; library because I cannot use modulo on a double.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Checking for an Integer value</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would use type-casting....</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The student answer can still help. Think about what happens when you cast a double to an int. Is there any way you can use that to figure out whether the value the user input was an integer?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Okay, I guess I could compare the double to its int counterpart, but this didn't work either because I was doing something like 1.0 vs static-casted(1.0) and it would accept that as true. :\ </p>

<p>Maybe I'm doing this wrong? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That specific test case (1.0 vs static_cast(1.0)) should result to true, as 1.0 years would be considered a valid input.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But if the instructions say that we should <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>check</strong></span> if the value is an int value, and if it isn't then we should <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong>re-prompt</strong></span> them, not convert the double to an int. :o</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>To follow this up, it says we're only allowed to use standard C++ libraries. I'm not sure what is considered standard and what isn't.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hmmm, I think I might be wrong about not being able to use other libraries because I read "You are only allowed to use C++ standard libraries" but I think that includes &lt;math.h&gt; ! </p>

<p>If so then my problem is solved!</p></TEXT>

Your files io.cpp and p1.cpp should be listed. If it is, run the compile command again, and it should work. If not, do what the instructor said and head down to office hours.</p></TEXT>

<p>Sorry but I'm just confused. The equations stated in the instructions doc says that we can find either the balance of the current month, or next month using:</p>

<p>B' = B - (P - (B * (r/12)))</p>
<p>B' = B * (1 + r/12) - P</p>

<p>but my question is where do I get B &amp; B' from?</p>

<p>To my understanding:</p>
<p>P =  is the monthly payment that was submitted by the user</p>
<p>r = Interest rate submitted by the user. </p>

<p>only knowing these, I can't really use the formulas given. I know I missing something though! :(</p>

<p>Look at James' explanation here: @32. Since your balance would be 0 on the 13th month, you can find the balance for the 12th month by plugging in 0 for B'. Then, just loop the equation using the previous months' balance until you get to month 1.</p>

If make works locally, check to be sure that you are not relying

Also, I can't open the file that autograder sends me. I also can't open the sample output/test files provided on cTools.

 <TEXT>
MakeFile?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In EECS 281 they use a more advanced build system to compile their programs. There's a program called "make" that uses a file called a "makefile" to automatically build a program. We're using their autograder so there's some irrelevant output. I assume the people who set up the autograder for our class put in a makefile of their own.</p>

<p>Most of that error message is irrelevant, just a reminder for 281 students. Could your issue be you tried to use the "floor" function without including "cmath" or "math.h"?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Yes, I forgot to include either of those; thanks!</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I submitted essentially the same code to the auto-grader twice.  The only change was that I split one of my code lines into two code lines so the line was less than 80 characters.  I noticed that when I made this change, the fracyears case went from taking 0.001 seconds to 0.003 seconds and the long case went from taking 0.037 seconds to 0.028 seconds.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why the time to complete the test cases would change when it is the same test case and the code stayed the same?</p>

<p>Just curious...Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Speed Code Runs</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It was probably random variation, the operating system could be doing other stuff while it processes your program and depending how they calculate time it could vary slightly from run to run.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes it's just some variation. First off don't worry about the run time, we're using the autograder from EECS 281 where they do grade for run time and so there is some extra stuff in the feedback.</p>

<p>Also multiple people's code is running in parallel in the autograder so if you submitted your code when a bunch of other people submitted your code will usually take slightly longer to run. but once again we don't care about the run time in this class.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>A user could enter a monthly payment amount with more than two decimals.  For example, they could say the monthly payment is 100.23532.  This is not a valid dollar amount because it has more than two decimals.  However, the code would still handle it like it is a valid amount since the input is a double.  </p>

<p>Hi Ayo,</p>

<p>The question I'm asking is slightly different.  I think the @32 thread is referring to the fact that <em>output</em> calculated by the Balance equation is slightly off.

<p>bash-4.1$ diff <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline">test1.out output1</span></strong><br />4c4,15<br />&lt; 1  99.59 0.41 99.59<br />---<br />&gt; 12 99.59 0.41  99.59<br />&gt; 11 99.17 0.83 198.76<br />&gt; 10 98.76 1.24 297.52<br />&gt; 9   98.35 1.65 395.87<br />&gt; 8   97.94 2.06 493.81<br />&gt; 7   97.54 2.46 591.35<br />&gt; 6   97.13 2.87 688.48<br />&gt; 5   96.73 3.27 785.21<br />&gt; 4   96.33 3.67 881.53<br />&gt; 3   95.93 4.07 977.46<br />&gt; 2   95.53 4.47 1072.99<br />&gt; 1   95.13 4.87 1168.12</p>

<p>Especially the: 4c4,15 part. What is it trying to tell me? :O </p>

<p>My result from the test1 and comparing to output1 is this... What does that mean? Where are they different?</p>

<p>lines with <strong><code>&gt;</code></strong> are from file 2 and are different from file 1.</p>

<p>So that is saying that a line is missing in your output. AKA The output1 file given to you has a line that your generated test.out doesn't have. :O</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hmm..  maybe your months are off by 1? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From what I can tell looking at my solution all the numbers are the same so I have no idea where I'm going wrong?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So if you interpret the "15a16 &gt;" using the key in the student answer, it appears you have an extra blank line. If your months were off by 1 or if you had extra text/numbers/anything except blank space, then it would show up in the diff results. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Figured it out! I just didn't save the file, I copied and pasted and it resulted in an extra blank line in output1! Thanks for the help!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok that makes sense but I'm not understanding where I could be off by a line</p></TEXT>

<p>Your code is either treating a valid input as invalid or vice versa. The P on the output is the P in principal which is supposed to print next (after years is input) as part of PrintHeader.</p>
<p>Based on the fact that your code is not printing that P it looks like your years error checking is too limiting</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It is stated in the spec that you should do error checking for years. If it is not an integer, reprompt questions by calling GetParam.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Bc of the way input streams work typing 1/2 will be read by the computer as just 1. Try typing .5 or 1.5.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have this same problem, and I do have error checking for years. When I input years as a decimal it calls GetParam again but when I put in a fraction (which i'm assuming fracyears means?? not sure) like for example, 1/2, as the input it prints out the data as if I entered 1. </p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>That happened to me when I uploaded main.cpp from the wrong project. My code failed to run so the auto grader didn't use a submit. Looked like this:</p>

make exited with non-zero exit status.
Be sure to include a Makefile and not to put your 
files in any subdirectory/subfolder in your submit.tgz. 
If make works locally, check to be sure that you are not relying
on built-in variables/rules by running make -r -R

<p>Just submitted to the autograder and I have a couple questions about the feedback -</p>

<p>1) At the top of the feedback email the autograder lists "Found x tokens in source" - I'm assuming x is the number of characters?  The autograder then warns that if x exceeds the student average by a significant amount to consider cutting down your source code - where can we see the student average?</p>

<p>2) For each of the test cases there is a memory usage (kb) and a memory budget (kb) - if I'm reading those numbers right my memory usage is WAY over the memory budget.  Is this something we need to be concerned with?</p>

<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>

<p>Do you know what lines are causing this? Can you summarize what they do without posting any code?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So it's bad style to use something like #define min_interest 0. Instead, you should make them global const ints instead.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>There's a general consensus that global const is much more preferable compared to #define. Preprocessor directives should be avoided whenever possible.</p>

<p>When we get into OOP, I prefer using getters rather than global const. Even if it's something as dumb-looking as...</p>
<pre>double getMinInterest()<br />{<br />	return 0.0;<br />}</pre>
<p>...I feel like it provides more options for expanding the implementation later on (by adding a private member variable and returning it instead) without breaking the higher abstraction layers. But, I'm not sure if there's a widely accepted guideline to that effect.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I used preprocessor directives for the variables that involved min and max for the GetParam function. The code defines the value of min_interest to 0. Since the min and max do not need to be changed. I thought it would be bad style to directly input the values in the parameter when calling them or declaring multiple variables for all the min and max values.</p></TEXT>

Is 1.000000000 (lots of decimal places) fair game for a valid years input?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, but it shouldn't matter the number of zeroes after the decimal. 1.0 = 1.000000000, and both are considered integers. Question @112 sort of addresses this as well.</p></TEXT>

<p>Try to think of all the ways your program can go wrong, and make a test cases for each way you come up with.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You should also make a few normal test cases to make sure you're calculating things properly.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the spec, it says that we don't need to worry about erroneous input. Aside from checking if years is an integer, is it just making test cases that go past the min/max for each of the inputs?</p></TEXT>

<p>the line you type when you compile should be:</p>
<pre>g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror -O1 io.cpp p1.cpp -o p1</pre>
<p>The error you're getting indicates that you're not including<em> io.cpp</em> in the compile line. You have to do this to link the two files together. It's not enough that <em>p1.cpp</em> knows that <em>io.h</em> exists and that <em>io.cpp</em> knows that<em> io.h</em> exists, because neither <em>p1.cpp</em> nor <em>io.h</em> knows that <em>io.cpp</em> exists (this is where the functions are defined). Essentially, the compiler only knows that a function called GetParm exists, but it does not know where to look for the definition because you have not linked<em> io.cpp.</em></p>

So I was in 183 and haven't used CAEN besides what we did in discussion so I'm very unfamiliar with all of this.
I have my p1.cpp on my CAEN desktop and i'm trying to run it in the terminal but it keeps telling me that the file isn't in the directory. How do I fix this? I did the cd command of my p1 folder (where p1.cpp is) but that didn't work, What am I doing wrong? once it's in my directory how do I start compiling with g++? I've been sifting through the 3 or so pdfs on c tools about this but can't seem to find the correct answer.</TEXT>

<p>From io.cpp, line 12:</p>
<pre>cin &gt;&gt; result;</pre>

<p>That line of code should pause and wait for user input, regardless of any other circumstances, no? Like the code shouldn't be going off in an endless loop if it gets to that line, it should stop and wait for the user to press enter before continuing to the next line, right? Or is there something in my p1.cpp file that would cause this line to be skipped in io.cpp?</p>

<p>The issue I'm having is that, when I enter a number as a fraction, GetParam runs, it displays the prompt then continues to display the same prompt until I ctrl-c out. I slapped in two other cout test statements above and below the line of code displayed above in io.cpp, and it prints both of those out fine (also in an infinite loop when testing fractions). Is there some reason in my io.cpp or the way I'm compiling (I'm using all the proper flags laid out in the spec)?</p>

<p>Decimals, min, and max all work as intended.</p>

<p>Oh, and this might also just be a Linux thing, but if I enter 7/32 it treats the input as 7, but if I enter (7/32) it starts having this issue. Is that just how Linux works, or should I be concerned about it not reading the /32 if I don't have parentheses?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Question about cin and a single test case issue</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>We will not test your code like that. The only input you will be getting is a whole number or a decimal. Also, please do not modify io.cpp.</p>

<p>For this project "fractional years" means input like 1.5, not input like 3/2, so you don't have to check for that.</p>

<p>This is not "just how Linux works", but rather just how cin works. So, when you have cin &gt;&gt; result and result is a double, cin will read in digits and a decimal until it hits something that is not a double (ie. a space, a parenthesis, slash, etc.). </p></TEXT>

<p>So you don't actually have any files called p1.cpp or io.cpp. The p1.cpp~ and io.cpp~ do not count, those are temporary files used by text editors like gedit. It's likely you can just rename them to p1.cpp and io.cpp and try again.</p></TEXT>

<p>You can go to mfile.umich.edu and download lab01.cpp or you can use secure copy (scp) to get it on your laptop. Here's a useful site that will show you how to use secure copy: http://www.hypexr.org/linux_scp_help.php</p></TEXT>

<p>The problem is that you didn't specify what directory to copy foobar.txt from. It should look something like this:</p>

<p>I tried this </p>

<p>Oh wait, are you trying this from the CAEN terminal or from your computer? Because if you're going from CAEN to your computer from within CAEN, then it would be something like:</p>
<pre>scp ~/eecs280/lab01/lab01.cpp username@remote_host_for_your_computer:/Users/MacBookPro/Desktop</pre>
<p>However, if you're copying from within your computer, it would look like this:</p>
<pre>$scp tgurkan@login.engin.umich.edu:~/eecs280/lab01/lab01.cpp /Users/MacBookPro/Desktop</pre>
<p>Essentially, wherever you're copying from or to that you're not ssh'd into, you need to add the username@remotehost:/Directory. </p>

 <TEXT>
variable type comparison</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. If the question is in regard to making sure the years value in project 1 is a whole number, then what we're really concerned with is the <em>value</em> of a hypothetical year variable rather than its <em>type</em>.  The type we get back from GetParam will always be double, because that's the way it is defined, but it's possible to check whether its value is an integer.</p>

<p>The two most common ways of doing involve either casting to an int or using the floor function.  If the value that results from either of these operations still compares as equal with the original, then it must have been an integer value.  (Because otherwise the fractional part would be missing and they wouldn't compare as equal.)</p></TEXT>

<p>So, I already submitted two times with the autograder. Today.</p>

<p>The first time, I got fracyears and long test cases failed. So I went back and look some more, change a few things that I think needed to be fixed, and submitted it again. But I still failed some tests.</p>

<p>Now, I can't submit no more, in case my submission isn't the right answer. So I'm wondering, what the heck should I do now?</p>

<p>When I tested the test1 file using diff, no error showed up. Also, when I input 4.5, 2.3 ...etc. for years, my terminal correctly prompts me for re-input. Hence my question about what fracyears looks for.</p>

<p>So far, I know that if I input actual fractions as years, the program fails (as in, if I input 3/3 that program doesn't take that as 1... but from what I read up here I'm supposed to not worry about that case). But I have no idea why I failed the test if my code was able to show no error with inputs such as 4.5 or 2.3.</p>

<p>Please help! Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Any way to check my program without using the autograder? Also, what does fracyears check for?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're going to have to write your own test cases and figure out what the answers are by hand. If you use a large number of years, I'd suggest figuring out what the first couple of months should be and check against that.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You should not reprompt when you get an input like 3.0. The long test case tests for a large number of years, the fracyears test case checks for a decimal year input.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No, it doesn't repromt for an input like 3.0. So really, I have no clue why it failed the fracyears test. But I'll go to the office hour!</p>

<p>Thanks for your help though!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So, what does the long test cases look for?</p>

<p>Also, what does the fracyears test cases look for? When I previously uploaded my file, my program passed my own testing. As I described, I input 4.5 and then 2.3, and a bunch of other numbers with decimals but not .0, my program prompts me, too. So I really don't know what else I can test for. (My program only fails when I input 3/3, but I thought I don't have to worry about that.)</p></TEXT>

<p>Does it matter if we use long, float, or double?  They all pretty much accomplish the same thing.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
data type clarity</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Long is an integer type. Float and double are decimal types.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So the only difference between float and double is that float is 32 bits and doubles are 64 bits. This essentially means that doubles are significantly more precise than floats. Unless it's really necessary, doubles are usually better to use.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So float or double is acceptable?</p></TEXT>

<p>I chose to use a cmath/math.h function which rounds down positive numbers (to the nearest, smaller integer), but rounds up the negative numbers (so -2.3 becomes -2.0 ... as in literally the .3 gets dropped).

<p>While I test my programs myself, typing in years with decimals (that do not end in .0) works just fine, but my program doesn't pass the autograder. Is there any insight that can be provided on this?</p>

<p>I don't think the helper function RMEs go in the header file, but I could be wrong.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you could be safe and just declare the helper functions as static in the cpp file and put the REMs in the cpp file. a static function means that it can't be used outside of that file which sounds like a great thing for functions that are only called in other functions in the same file!!</p></TEXT>

<p>Hello~ I don't mean to be rude, but I was just seeing if anyone had any real ideas on how to improve the labs, particularly in discussions held in places like the Dental Building. where the internet is terrible and there are no provided computers.</p>

<p>The problem particularly is that the lab seems to focus on using CAEN Redhat Linux- which is reasonable in itself. However, that requires us to bring our own laptops and use the VNC applications- which relies on the internet. MWireless frankly didn't work in the Dental Building, although many of us <strong>could</strong> work with the VNC over MGuest. However, there many of us could not, and I heard from a few people that it was slow (and I know someone's VNC client disconnected/crashed, which means restarting the client and reopening everything).</p>

<p>I apologize if this note is cumbersome, but can anyone suggest any ideal solutions? I saw the tables had ethernet ports next to the power outlets, but the tables weren't really connected to anything. There <em>is</em> the possibility of asking a department to refit the entire room with ethernet cables, but that's, say, 42 cables throughout the room.</p>

<p>Personally, however, I had little trouble. I dual-booted Ubuntu Linux, downloaded everything, then disconnected from the internet. Dual-booting has its own benefits - ranging from customizability to not relying on CAEN unless software is necessary. However, it also comes with its own disadvantages when put to a large-scale- having to ask students to randomly install some random OS and then make sure they have all the right packages installed (fortunately, many are at least included in the normal Ubuntu installation).</p>

<p>To put it simply:</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>-&gt; We are expected to use CAEN Linux</p>
<p>-&gt; Internet is far too cumbersome for all students to use CAEN VNC</p>

<p><strong>Solutions(</strong>?)</p>
<p>-&gt; Wait until more and more people stop coming, or switch to discussions with better conditions (?)</p>
<p>-&gt; Refit the rooms with ethernet cables</p>
<p>-&gt; Ask some students to dual-boot with a Linux distribution</p>
<p><br />This will probably be quite redundant if the next labs actually <strong>don't</strong> expect Linux, but I'm curious- will we be focusing on using Linux, and if so, how can we solve that? Also, I guess this isn't that serious of an issue as many of us will probably just use Visual Studios or such, and then later test it on CAEN. However, would that really help us students in the end?<br /><br />Thanks for considering this, even if I'm over thinking this far, far, far too much~</p></TEXT>

<p><br />This will probably be quite redundant if the next labs actually <strong>don't</strong> expect Linux, but I'm curious- will we be focusing on using Linux, and if so, how can we solve that? Also, I guess this isn't that serious of an issue as many of us will probably just use Visual Studios or such, and then later test it on CAEN. However, would that really help us students in the end?<br /><br />Thanks for considering this, even if I'm over thinking this far, far, far too much~</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Improving Labs?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Agreed.  We also had a few issues in my lab, mostly because the computer hooked up to the projector wasn't a CAEN machine and didn't even have either of ssh or VNC.</p>

<p>We'll let you all know what we think of during our staff meeting, but some partial good news is that for the labs in particular it isn't crucial that you use CAEN Linux.  The labs are only graded for completion, and so there aren't the same compatibility concerns as there are with the projects.  As long as you have some environment in which you can work (e.g. xcode on a mac, visual studio on windows, etc.), you should be able to complete the labs without issues.</p>

<p>That being said, the first lab is somewhat an exception as it focuses on learning to use the CAEN Linux environment.  We understand it must have been pretty frustrating to try to work on that without a solid way to connect to CAEN.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry for that. We will discuss about it tomorrow in the staff meeting. Hopefully, it will be resolved before next week.</p></TEXT>

<p>I was wondering but for the test case that is already written, listA was created for us. However when I print the list it shows up as ( 4 3 2 1 0 ) rather than ( 0 1 2 3 4 ). Is this how its supposed to be or is something wrong with my code? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
p2-tests</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That is how it works. When you refer to definition of list_make() in recursive.cpp, you may find that it calls Recursive_list with the new element and the old list as arguments. Then you refer to definition of constructor for Recursive_list, it calls</p>
<pre>copy_nodes(first-&gt;next, lst.first);</pre>
<p>It will thus be clear that the new element will be followed by the old list and resulting in (4 3 2 1 0).</p>

<p>Try to read code and understand it is one of the purposes.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm having trouble understanding the intended path for an in-order traversal, as mentioned in the project specification for the traversal function. For example, suppose I have the tree below, in which two elements both appear to be left-most, but one is higher up on the tree than the other:</p>
<pre>   4<br />  / \<br /> 2<br />/ \<br />   8<br />  / \<br /> 9<br />/ \ </pre>
<p>Which is considered more to the left, the 2 or the 9? </p>

<p>On a related note, suppose a path starts out to the right of an element, but then has several left branches that lead it to the left of that element, as shown below:</p>
<pre>     4<br />    / \<br />       5<br />      / \<br />     3<br />    / \<br />   6<br />  / \<br /> 7<br />/ \</pre>
<p>In this case, which is the left-most element, the 4 or the 7?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
In-Order Traversal</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If I understand trees correctly, the leftmost node is the farthest you can go left without ever having to go right. It makes more sense when you consider that the leftmost value will be the least in the tree, and values that are less than their parent node are always placed to the left. So to answer your question, I'm pretty sure the 2 and 4 are the respective leftmost nodes in your trees.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>in the first example the 2 is more left than the 9 because to get to the 9 you have to go to the right child node of 2 and once again the 4 is the left most because to get to the 7 you have to go right of the 4</p>

<p>to get to the left most node start at the head node (top node) then keep taking the left child node until the left child node is null (there isn't one to the left)</p>

<p>Hope that makes sense and good for you for starting the project on the day it is released!!!</p></TEXT>

<p>We are told in the project specification that we can call our own list functions when implementing other list functions, but are we also allowed to call our own list functions when implementing the binary tree functions in the third part of the project?</p></TEXT>

<p>"Requires fn must be associative."</p>

<p>Does this mean fn (a function I presume) mean it must have addition and multiplication, or something? Because those functionalities are associative?</p>

<p>And then the identity for addition is 0, and the identity for multiplication is 1? Is this enveloped in the function accumulate or do we have to check that the indentity matches for the type of fn?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Questions about the accumulate function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>A lot of functions can be associative, not just addition and multiplication. Essentially we just want f(a,b) = f(b,a); where a and b are integers.</p>

<p>To answer your second question, the requirements are supposed to be enforced by the function's user and can be assumed to be true when implementing the function. So you shouldn't have to (and are realistically unable to) check whether the identity in the function call is actually the function's identity, you just trust the user to know what they're doing.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The * is part of the function pointer syntax which denotes that fn represents a pointer to a function. In the actual accumulate function you can use fn just like a regular function (ie. x = fn(a, b)). </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is that * next to fn in the function header a pointer to whatever function is being passed as an argument?  I haven't coded with pointers before but I understand the general idea.</p></TEXT>

<p>According to sheet:</p>

<p>Effects: returns the sum of each element in list zero if the list is empty</p>

<p>Was this meant to say "non-empty"?</p>

<p>If not, what is list zero supposed to be defined as?</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
int sum, int product functions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This means that the function returns the sum of the integer elements of the list. If the list is empty, meaning that it contains zero elements, the function returns 0. </p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yeah, they're in recursive.cpp</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>im a bit confused..are the functions listed in recursive.h files already implemented for us? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In "p2-tests.cpp", the instructions specify that test cases should be placed in their own functions. Is it sufficient to write one abstract test case function for each implemented function, and then call said test function multiple times.</p>

<p>For example, would it be alright to create a function called "test_sum" which is implemented multiple times in main() to test that the sum function is working correctly? There would then be another similar function for product, accumulate, etc. Or would it be better that each specific test case be placed in their own function (ie "test_sum_empty" would test for an empty list and "test_sum_long" would test a long list)?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Functions for Test Cases</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This is a question I came up with also, and what I decided to do is put my test cases in one function. So for all of my sum cases, they are all located in "test_sum." And I only reach the "PASS!" if all of my test cases pass. (Maybe we need PASS! for each test case, I am not sure, but I followed the given which had only one cout for PASS! after "implement your own test cases here!")</p>

<p>So my test_sum tests all of my cases at once and prints out PASS! if they all passed.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>testing your code is really up to you, you can do it either way each has their own advantage, but I highly recommend following the example test case of using asserts, that way it's easier to see which case broke your code. Also asserts are just good practice in code.</p></TEXT>

<p>1. About the accumulate() function :</p>
<p>In the spec. it use add( ) as an example. So do we need to actually implement whatever associative fn we want to test in the p2-tests.cpp? </p>
<p>( I didn't see related function declared anyplace in the files provided, so I have to write one to test the function, then I have to modify the format of p2-tests.cpp ---- I add the function implementation in p2-tests.cpp. Is that ok?)</p>

<p>2. I use a lot of helper function in solving the tail-recursion thing. But in the spec. it says it is not a necessity. So I am wondering, for every problem in project2, is there always a solution not using helper function? Or it is the reverse: only small part of the functions can be finished without using a helper function?</p>


<p>Thanks !</p>

associative function in accumulate() &amp; helper function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>1. If you want to test the accumulate function you do need to implement another function, such as add, to pass as an argument to accumulate. So you could add this accumulate test (including the add function) to p2-tests.cpp. </p>

<p>2. Some of the tail-recursive functions can easily be implemented without a helper function and others cannot. However, none of the functions need multiple helper functions. I've seen 3 helper functions for 1 tail-recursive function in the past, that is too complicated and unnecessary. </p></TEXT>

<p>Yes. But I am asking, the instructor ask me to create another test file other then p2-tests.cpp to test accumulates(), which is not contained in the make file. Is that necessary?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry, I did not know that p2-tests.cpp was the file you need to submit, I thought it was the test file we provided. I've updated my answer accordingly. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So p2-tests.cpp is not the only test file we submit ? Why can't I just implement the add() function inside p2-tests.cpp ? (like the list_equal( ) provided )?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For functions like <em>reverse</em>, is it sufficient for the test case to print out the original list, and then print out the reverse list and then we can expect the user to be able to check if it did it properly? </p>

<p>Example: </p>
<p>Original listA: ( 4 3 2 1 0 )</p>
<p>Reverse listA: ( 0 1 2 3 4 )</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could see how it would be possible to write functions to automatically check this, but it would require a fair amount of extra code to write one for all the functions. </p>

<p>Additionally, can we expect any input as to what the standards will be for grading test cases? </p></TEXT>

Test Cases for Project 2</TEXT>

<p>I would make a quick function to initialize a list_t from an integer array or string of single digits, which will make testing most of the list functions a lot easier. Then you can just compare the actual and expected lists.</p></TEXT>

<p>There's a section towards the end of the project 2 specification pdf that should help with testing. It talks about p2-tests.cpp, which includes a function list_equal() that could help with automatic checking.</p>

<p>While it works to show you your code is working along the way, you probably can't have your final version test with a print for visual inspection since this output would upset the autograder.</p></TEXT>

<p>There is no way to directly access the elements of a list other than the first, that's why lists and recursion go so well together.</p>

<p>For this project, a list is either empty, or it's a number with a list on the end. You can only access the first element (through list_first()) and the rest of the elements (through list_rest()). To access the nth element, you would need a recursive function that broke off the first element and passed the next call of itself the rest of the list repeating the process until you reach the element you want.</p>

<p>It's fairly hard to conceptualize, but it might help to think of a heavy metal chain, where you can only add or remove a link (on the end) at a time </p></TEXT>

Then, for each function you write, you need some test cases, which will go in p2-tests.cpp. There's already a few functions declared in that file and a sample test case. So basically you'll be writing code in p2.cpp and p2-tests.cpp.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain to me clearly what the accumulate function is supposed to do better than the RME?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
accumulate function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p dir="ltr">int accumulate(list_t list, int (*fn)(int, int), int identity);</p>
<p>the inputs are a list, a function pointer for a function that takes in two ints and returns an int, and an int. A function pointer is a way to let a function have multiple functionality that are similar depending on what the function you use as input. I believe you are going to be covering more on function pointers in lecture next week.</p>


<p> the accumulate function accumulates the values of the inputted list based on what ever the function that is inputted in the function pointer input does.</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
A pointer to any associative function that produces and integer out of two integers can be used for fn. For example if I had the simple function:
<pre>int add(int a, int b)
{
	// Add a and b, return result
}</pre>
I could use '(*add)' as the function pointer argument to accumulate.
The identity number is a number that when used as an argument to a specific function that takes two arguments (a binary function), causes that function to return the other argument. 
That might not sound especially useful, but when we recursively call a binary function(like add) on a list we need to keep storing our results to a variable. The thing that stores the result (I'll call it the accumulator), only wants the results of the function performed on members of the list, and itself (the previous result).
Unfortunately our function is binary , and needs two arguments, not the one list element we have accessible in a recursive step. The identity value lets you use the first member of the list without affecting it in any way, which in turn lets you use the first two arguments on the next recursive step.
This can be pretty confusing to explain in words, I would try to give more of an example but the intuitive examples of this are a more general form of our sum and product functions in the project, which I don't think I can post on Piazza.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What is the identity number used for?</p>
<p>Also what is supposed to be inputted to the function pointer (fn)? Like the first and second element or the first element and the cumulative result value?</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Are we supposed to used helper functions for most of the functions?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Helper Functions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>can you think of a way to make the functions tail recursive given the inputs to each of the functions? If not using helper functions would probably be a good idea</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I didn't see it in the spec but I thought I had read it somewhere. Can we have partners for project 2?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Partner</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If for the last step of a function call of one of the functions we were supposed to implement, I recusively call the function, but do so inside another function, such as:<br /><br />return make_list(ele, recruseCall(list))</p>

<p>Am I correct in assumming this does not count as tail end recurison?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Tail End recursion</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That's right!  The call to make_list has to happen afterwards and counts as "doing work", so it's not tail recursion. (And consequentially we couldn't reuse the current stack frame.)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If I understand your question correctly, then you're right: It's only tail recursive if the value that the base case returns gets passed back up without being changed. If at any point during the recursion, you get back the return value from your recursive call and do more work before returning, it's not tail recursive.</p>
<p>That's not to say the base case isn't allowed to do any work before returning. It has its very own stack frame to work in up until it returns. It's not making a recursive call, so it doesn't have to worry about getting all its work done before making a recursive call.</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Just to make sure I'm understanding this: if a recursive helper function is on its final call (or at the base case), you can modify the values prior to returning and this is still considered tail recursive?</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>if I understand you correctly you're asking if something like this is still tail recursive</p>

<pre>//code before<br />if(n == 0)<br />{<br />   result =+ 10;<br />   return result;<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />//not base case code stuff<br />}</pre>
<p>then yes this is still tail recursive because you're at the base case so you are not making another recursive call to the function so there can not be any work that happens after the recursive call (because there is no such call).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Just to clarify, it's not tail recursion if the function reaches the base case and, prior to returning,  changes are made to values stored in the top stack frame? It's only tail recursive if the value passed through the last recursive call is the final return value of the recursive function?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Can I call an implemented function in another implemented function? Could I call, for example, reverse inside of append?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Calling implemented functions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes. From the spec: "You may call any of these functions in the implementation of another."</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If I made a call to a non-recursive function as an argument for a recursive function (example: in sum_helper() I call list_rest() for the list_t parameter), does it count as tail-recursion?</p>

 <TEXT>
Non-recursive function call for argument in a recursive function?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I began working on the project and managed to write what I hope is a correct implementation of the sum() function. However, when I went to test it with the single test case given, it threw an error. I wanted to see what was going on, so I put a cout &lt;&lt; result (result is an int keeping track of the sum) as well as a call to list_print() in the helper function to see exactly what was going on when I called sum().</p>

<p>However, when I call sum() from main(), nothing prints. I made sure to put sum_helper above sum, #included everything, etc. I put a simple cout &lt;&lt; "hello" in both sum() and its helper function (so two hello's should print),  but only one does; it turns out that it's the one in sum() that's printing. What is going on?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: the issue has been resolved. turns out i made a very silly mistake in a function call.</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, I have another small question: If I made a call to a non-recursive function as an argument for a recursive function (example: in sum_helper() I call list_rest() for the list_t parameter), does it count as tail-recursion?</p>

 <TEXT>
Initial difficulties</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The thing you need to consider is whether there is work done between when the recursive call is done and when the return happens.  In your case, since the arguments would all happen before the recursive call, they shouldn't interfere with it being tail-recursive.</p></TEXT>

<p>In the REM for the rotate function, there is no limitation to the value that n may be assigned. That being said, the spec does not specify how the rotate function should deal with values of n that are greater than the number of elements in the list.</p>

<p>For example, say we input "rotate((1 2 3 4), 5)." Would the returned list be (2 3 4 1), which is equal to "rotate((1 2 3 4), 1)"?</p>

<p>This seems like it would not fit the specification regarding moving the "first n elements", as there are not 5 elements to move.</p>

<p>I could not find a precise definition of  "empty tree" in the project2 pdf.  Is it</p>

<p>a would mean a tree with 5 as the top element but no left or right subtree would not be an empty tree</p>

<p>b would mean a tree with 5 as the top element but no left or right subtree would be an empty tree</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
What is an empty tree?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
A bit of both, actually. An empty tree has no root first and foremost. It also has no subtrees. Notice that if you attempt to call tree_elt, tree_left or tree_right on an empty tree, you will get an error.
Also, single element trees always have left and right subtrees. Those subtrees are in fact empty trees.</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>in the case of this project trees will always have 0, 1, or 2 children (branches), a subtree can be any number of leafs. you can have a huge tree that is several layers deep and a sub tree could be everything to the left of the root.</p>

<p>In general trees can have any number of branches but in most cases binary trees where there is just a left and a right branch are the most common.</p></TEXT>

<p>How do we make tree test cases for our tree functions?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Binary Tree Test Cases</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you make them just like how you made cases for the list functions. you have to make trees and figure out what the functions you wrote should do then run them on the trees you made and check to make sure it's what expected.</p>

<p>also making trees is kind of tricky because you need to nest the tree_make function a lot. use the tree_print() function a lot to make sure the tree you make is the one you actually want.</p>

<p>tree_make(2, ( tree_make( 1, tree_make(), tree_make() ) ), ( tree_make( 3, tree_make(), tree_make() ) ) )</p>
<p>this will give you a tree that looks like this:</p>
<p>        2</p>
<p>      /    \</p>
<p>    1     3</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No, they're not impossible to test. You just have to know exactly what kind of tree or return value you're expecting, and then compare what you expect to what your function(s) actually return. So if you're expecting tree_sum to return number X for a tree of 10+ elements, then test it to make sure it's returning X. Same thing goes when you're comparing trees using tree_equal(). It might be a little tedious, but if you're using a function on a large tree, you're going to need a *correct* large tree to compare it to.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you also dont have to make the trees and lists by hand, you can make a function that turns an array or string into a list or tree. The tree one is a bit tough but its not really any harder than the functions we're implementing.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>tree_make(2, ( tree_make( 1, tree_make(), tree_make() ) ), ( tree_make( 3, tree_make(), tree_make() ) ) )</p>

<p>How would i do 2 of these trees with a top element "1"?  It seems too laborious.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>to make two different trees it would be two different calls to tree_make, and the first value in the function is the root value just replace the 2 in the example with a 1. remember the parameters for the tree_make function are tree_make(int value, tree_t left, tree_t right)</p>
<p>basically you construct big trees out of a bunch of smaller trees </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So are the trees with 8+ numbers impossible to test?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Can you use list_make(variable, list name) without first making an empty list? For example if i write "list_t NEWlist = list_make(first, NEWlist)" will this make a list containing just the value contained in the variable first? Or is it necessary that i make a new empty list first? </p>

<p>Also, Are we allowed to use one of the functions we write in another on of the functions. ex: can i use my reverse function in my append function?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Creating a new list and using functions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>make a new empty list first</p></TEXT>

<p>I am pretty sure the compiler will yell at you if you try to use the variable you are trying to declare on the same line. simple solution is </p>
<p>list_t NEWlist = list_make();</p>
<p>NEWlist = list_make(first, NEWlist);</p>

<p>and yes you are totally allowed to use previous functions in other functions just make sure you are still making your functions tail recursive.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>without seeing your code I'm not really sure what to say but I will say that helper functions help you save things by making them parameters of the helper function</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
helper function declaration</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This is probably due to not declaring your additional helper functions (properly) at the top of the p2.cpp file.</p>

<p>Let's say you had this function somewhere in your code (below int main() of course):</p>
<pre>static list_t rotateHelperFunc(int x) {<br />	// Code here<br />}</pre>
<p>You have to write a function prototype - just like those in the p2.h file - for each of the extra functions you wrote. These go before the main() function, and would look like this:</p>
<pre>static list_t rotateHelperFunc(int x);<br />// Don't forget to write an RME for this</pre>
<p>In other words, it looks <strong>exactly</strong> the same as when you use it, except it doesn't have the actual code for the function (ie anything inside the brackets). You have to make sure the function prototypes include the "static" part, the return type, same name, and same parameters (the "int x" part(s)).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Declare the static helper functions in p2.cpp (see followup discussion @289). Please write RMEs for all your helper functions, even if they look very similar (hey, at least you can copy-paste and just tweak a bit in those cases).</p>

<p>If you declare the static helper functions in p2.h, you'll probably get an error message when you go to compile.  p2tests.cpp includes p2.h, so p2tests.cpp will think it has this static function that was declared, but not defined.</p>

<p>no as it was stated in the spec you are not allowed to use any outside libraries that were not specified. also the list library wouldn't help because that library refers to a different type of list object, not the one we made for this project<br /><br />but it wouldn't be hard at all to write your own length function</p>

<p>well there really is only one way to write this function tail recursively, so I don't see why you can't use it.</p>
<p>but yes just to be safe make a comment siting where you got the function and make sure you use the tail recursive version!</p>

<p>Im a bit confused as to what the test list_equal does exactly, and how we can use it to test our reverse function?!</p>

<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
What does list_equal test do?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The function takes in two lists as its parameters. If the lists are equal, then it returns true. If not, it returns false.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>A good model for test cases is to start with some sample input, figure out by hand what the output should be for that input, run the function you're testing with that input, and see if your actual output is the same as your expected output.</p>
<p>list_equal can help you with that last step: it takes two lists and returns true if they're the same. So if you wish you could write</p>
<pre>if (expectedList == actualList)  //This wouldn't actually work
	cout &lt;&lt; "It worked!" &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
<p>instead write</p>
<pre>if (list_equal(expectedList, actualList)) 
	cout &lt;&lt; "It worked!" &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>

<p>list_first(l1) = 1 and list_fist(l2) = 4, so they are not equal, and the function returns false.</p></TEXT>

<p>First off, compile via the make command [I just type "make"], which will compile the "p2-tests.cpp" file. That p2-tests.cpp file is where you should make all your tests for each function- there's already an example in there.

<p>In short:</p>
<ul><li>Put tests in p2-tests.cpp file</li><li>Use "make" command to compile it all</li><li>Don't put an "int main()" inside your p2.cpp file</li></ul>

<p>I don't understand the accumulate function's parameter "identity" . What is suppose to go in there? I see a 0 in the RME, but I'm not sure what that means. Is it suppose to be the "starter" of the *fn that we use? Like in addition we start at 0, and in multiplication we would use 1? </p>

<p>I read here that: </p>

<p><em>"The identity number is a number that when used as an argument to a specific function that takes two arguments (a binary function), causes that function to return the other argument. "</em></p>

<p>Yes, you can do that. All your recursive functions are declared in p2.h already, so it doesn't matter what order you implement them in p2.cpp. It would only make a difference if you didn't declare your helper functions before implementing their related functions (i.e. implementing chop helper after chop without declaring chop helper first).</p></TEXT>

<p><strong>Do we or do we not have to worry about negative "n" values? </strong></p>

<p>Instructor "Vidal Borromeo" noted: From the point of view of your function, "n" is always non-negative. There is nothing special you need to do regarding trying to detect if a negative number was accidentally passed in."<br /><br />However, the answer above that was endorsed by another instructor is confusing. Unsigned converts the number to positive, yes... But -1 isn't suddenly turned into 1, for my linux test the number -5 into an unsigned int x turned into 4294967291... So because there is no requires clause and unsigned technically does create a positive number... Do we or do we not have to worry about negative "n" values?<br /><br /></p>

 <TEXT>
<p>That stuff is function pointers. It will probably be talked about in a later lecture.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You don't need the pointer function material to work out this problem. Just try to assume that fn is an add function, then accumulate() is like "add up all the elements in the list". If you assume that fn is an product function, then what accumulate does is to multiply all the elements in the list. The identity, as is the spec. is use to make sure you return the correct value when the list contains only one element. </p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Just curious, so accumulate() with fn as an add function, isn't that just the sum(list_t list) function? Is there a practical use for accumulate, since right now it just seems like a more.. interesting version of product(list_t list) and sum(list_t list). Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As it says, accumulates() works well as long as fn you passed in is associative.  I forgot what other binary operations are associative, so I search it:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property</a></p>

<p>So in the example part, you can see that there are many more other associative binary operations ( composition of function... set intersection...). A guess:  set operation can be useful since even though now what we store in list_t is integer, but we can actually store another list. Then accumulate() can give you the union of elements ... I think (the prototype of accumulate() might need some change)</p>

<p>In a word, with accumulate(), you don't need to write each one separately...</p></TEXT>

<p>Awesome, thanks!</p></TEXT>

list_print errors</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You would have to declare and initialize listA before calling list_print(listA).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You don't need to declare listA as const. The const for function parameter means that in the scope of this function, the content of this parameter can't be changed. It is always applied to functions passing references and pointers as parameters if no change is expected for them.</p></TEXT>

<p>Is it acceptable to use the C++ ternary operator? It was not taught in ENGR 101, however I've come across it in the past and found it pretty useful. That being said, if it isn't considered stylistically proper, I'd rather not use it.</p>

<p>For example, if I had the following code:</p>
<p>    if (test == true) {</p>
<p>        return 1;</p>
<p>    } else {</p>
<p>        return 0;</p>

<p>    return test ? 1 : 0;</p>

 <TEXT>
Accessing list elements</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No, a list isn't like an array. The only way to access an element of a given list - especially for the purposes of this project - is through the functions list_first and list_rest. So in your example you could get the first element of the list, 3, from the return value of list_first. Then from there you can use list_rest and a little bit of extra code to get your next element, and so on.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Nope, no loops allowed in this project. Read the spec! It's pretty explicit about not using loops.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, I was confused because in class there was an instance pointed out where we could use a for loop.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>However, you CAN use a loop to build up a list like they have as their sample test case!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Right - no loops only applies to the function implementations. I'd definitely use loops to create lists, especially long ones, if possible.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>May we use loops to go through each element of a list and then assert that the element satisfies a particular condition?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's probably easier to use the already made function list_isEqual. That takes two lists and returns true if they match. So I constructed a list that I expect from calling my function, and then I called the function and asserted if the two were true.</p>

<p>If you want to inspect element by element, you would have to go through the lists and compare the first of the first with the first of the second, then the next, and the next…. etc.</p></TEXT>

<p>Anything related to lists have to be tail recursive. And the function calls the helper function (if you choose to use one).</p>

<p>To clarify this and the instructor answers, in the factorial example was fact tail recursive or just the helper? You'll notice fact didn't even call itself.  Only the helper did that.  Remember what it means for a function to be recursive.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Anything related to lists have to be tail recursive. And the function calls the helper function (if you choose to use one).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Think about it this way - we would ideally like to avoid all helper functions and just write the original tail recursively.  Unfortunately, the tail recursive version often needs an extra parameter to keep track of the result so far.  When you originally call the function, you have to pass in the identity (e.g. 0 for addition, 1 for multiplication, etc.).  This gets annoying, and so we fix the problem by making a helper function do all the work and having the nominal function act as a "shorthand" for calling the helper with the identity plugged in as the extra parameter.</p>

<p>For example, we do all the work in this function</p>
<p style="text-align:left" dir="ltr"><tt>fact_helper(int n, int soFar){</tt><br /><tt>  // do tail recursive stuff</tt></p>
<p style="text-align:left" dir="ltr"><tt>}</tt></p>
<p style="text-align:left" dir="ltr"></p>
<p style="text-align:left" dir="ltr">but we create a wrapper around it</p>
<p style="text-align:left" dir="ltr"><tt>fact(int n){</tt></p>
<p style="text-align:left" dir="ltr"><tt>  return fact_helper(n, 1);</tt></p>
<p style="text-align:left" dir="ltr"><tt>}</tt></p>
<p style="text-align:left" dir="ltr"></p>
<p style="text-align:left" dir="ltr">so that in our other code we can just call something like <tt>fact(3)</tt> instead of having to type <tt>fact(3,1)</tt>.</p></TEXT>

<p>Because the labs are graded for completion and the surveys are a part of this, you won't receive a "score" other than the pass/fail for the lab.  For the conceptual questions on the surveys, this means as long as you put forth a legitimate attempt you don't have anything to worry about.</p>

<p>I just start my project. I'm wondering that what is Node? How should I use it?</p>

What is Node? How should we use it?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>A node is just anywhere where there is number on the tree.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>A Node is a private type inside of the list_t class. That being said you can't actually access a Node type outside of the list_t type. You will learn all about this later in class when we go over classes. Also we haven't gone over pointers in class yet so parts of it shouldn't make sense yet but when you're done with the entire class you should be able to understand all the code we have given to you.</p>

<p>no, do not change any part of any of those files. You just need to make a file called p2.cpp then write the functions that are declared in p2.h. You are allowed to write more functions in p2.cpp than are in the .h file. HINT HINT helper functions are useful.</p>

<p>All the functions that you are going to use to interact with list_t and tree_t types are all in the recursive.h file or other functions you have written yourself.</p>

<p>hopefully that answers your question and any follow up questions!</p></TEXT>

<p>We're not covering extra material or anything in the named discussion groups, but if one of them calls out to you, you might learn more by being there.</p>

<p>For example, if you're somewhat new to coding, you might benefit from being in a discussion section with others who are similarly new and have similar questions -- someone might ask about the same thing you were struggling with. It can be intimidating to ask questions if you think all of your classmates already know the answers. In that case, you might learn more in the White Belt Coders section. </p>

<p>If you're an experienced coder, being in a class with other experienced coders might help you learn more. You might all have the basics down, and you can trade higher-level tips and tricks. Experienced coders might also raise questions that will challenge you more. If that sounds good to you, Black Belt Coders could help you learn more.</p>

<p>As for Girls Who Code, it's more a matter of being comfortable. CS has historically attracted more guys than girls, which means that sometimes girls can feel outnumbered or out of place, and that can be a distraction.

<p>In one of the functions being implemented, I'm calling a separate tail-recursive function in the return statement once it reaches the base case. Basically, I pass two changing lists tail-recursively, and when the base case comes up, the function returns append(first , second) to get the correct output. It never has to recoil the stack frames once it finishes appending the two lists, so would that still make the function tail-recursive? Or would I have to adjust it?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Calling a tail-recursive function within another function.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Calling a tail-recursive function within a tail-recursive function would still be tail-recursive. For example, if for some reason you have to call reverse_list at some point in one of your other functions, as long as the rest of that function is tail-recursive, you're fine.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't really get how to make this function tail recursive at all. The only way to iterate over a list is to use list_rest and get the first value, but once you've called list_rest on a list, you remove an element you'll need later to put inside of the new reversed list. So I'm a little confused. I've thought about using a helper, I'm not sure what to make it do since I can't really store numbers with it because for every step into the recursion, you lose information that was stored in the previous call of the recursive function. :\</p>

<p>Confused! :|</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Reverse function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So you have two functions that are useful in this problem. The first, like you said, is list_rest. The second is list_make, which either creates an empty list or appends a number to the beginning of an existing list. So think about how you can use these two functions in conjunction to keep track of things.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Not exactly. The trick to using tail recursion is to keep track of what you've done so far so you don't have to retrace your steps once you reach your base case. If you're only keeping track of the last element, then you still have to retrace. You have to figure out a way of keeping track of all the elements you've seen all at once such that when you reach your base case, you can just return a list without having to do any more work.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks. :)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is the correct way to think about this function to go all the way to the last element then figure out how to add the previous elements? </p></TEXT>

<p>Is it true that, for <em>any</em> sorted binary tree and for <em>any</em> integer, it is possible to find a place to insert that integer in the sorted binary tree? My intuition tells me yes, but I wanted to clarify. One example is this:</p>

<pre>        4

    2       6
   / \     / \
  1   3   5   7

<p>If I gave insert_tree an integer argument of 4, would the correct insertion be</p>
<pre>        4
      /   \

    2       6
   / \     / \
  1   3   5   7
 / \ / \ / \ / \
         4
        / \</pre>
<p>(The 4 is in the left subtree of the number 5)</p>
<p>I ask because in the spec, it says</p>
<p>"The right subtree is a sorted binary tree, and all elements in the right subtree are<br />greater than or equal to the top element of the tree."</p>

<p>In this case, the right subtree has top element 6, but inserting 4 would mean it's less than 6.</p>

<p>Is it true that, for <em>any</em> sorted binary tree and for <em>any</em> integer, it is possible to find a place to insert that integer in the sorted binary tree? My intuition tells me yes, but I wanted to clarify. One example is this:</p>

<pre>        4<br />      /   \<br />     /     \<br />    2       6<br />   / \     / \<br />  1   3   5   7<br /> / \ / \ / \ / \</pre>

 <TEXT>
insert_tree question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For your example, you would insert the 4 as the left subtree of the 5. This does create a valid binary tree because the root is 4 and all values on the left subtree are less than and all values on the right subtree are greater than or equal to 4. </p>

<p>For the subtree with root 6, this is also a valid subtree. The left subtree contains only values less than 6, and the right subtree only contains values greater than or equal to 6.</p>

<p>The definition of a well-formed binary tree is recursive, so it is implied that for any root of a subtree the left tree contains only values less than the root, and the right tree contains only values greater than or equal.</p></TEXT>

<p>Quick question about using labster for Lab 2.</p>

<p>When working on the countDigits tail recursive function, the lab says to feel free to add a helper function to keep track of the result.</p>
<p>When I add the helper function labster throws the error ""countDigitsTail_helper" was not declared in this scope."</p>
<p>If I place static in front of the function as with helper functions in Project 2, I get a big long syntax error and in either way, the code will not compile.</p>

<p>So there are two solutions: </p>

<p>2) Define the helper function above the function where you use it the first time</p>

<p>The reason you're getting that error is because you're using a function before it is either declared or defined. Imagine using functions like using any other variable: you have to declare it before you use it.</p></TEXT>

If you wait until you have deleted all the numbers, think about what you have left, and that will explain why you are off by one. </p></TEXT>

<p>I think I've got the recursive function for sum. How would I test just that function? Can I just run the "make p2-tests" command to test for my recursive sum function, or does the make command only test the entire project (meaning I would need to have all the other functions complete to run it)?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
How to Test Code</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You test each of your function separately, just like what the example test does in the p2-tests.cpp. You think of some other input and corresponding output, compare the output you setup with the actually output you get.</p>

<p>For example you want to test for product(), you first need a list to passed to in, right. So you create a list and fill in some numbers (like what the example test case does), then you compute the output you expect, and also passed the list you made up into the product() to see if it gives what you expect. </p></TEXT>

<p>Two quick questions:<br /><br /></p>
<p>1) For test functions, do we need to write RMEs for them? (such as listSum_test();, instead of "putting all our tests in main()")</p>

<p>2) Do we need to declare functions "static" for test functions as well?<br /><br />So it's static void listSum_test() {}</p>

<p>Alright! Thanks so much!</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>What it would do depends on what bool (*fn)(int) is. That parameter is a function pointer for a function that takes an int and returns a boolean value. So your list will be filtered to become a new list containing only the elements for which fn() evaluates to true.</p>

<p>Think of it as a sort of extension of the filters even and odd functions. For example, filter_even filters such that it returns a list containing only the even elements of the original list. Now with filter, you want your function to filter such that the list returned contains only the elements for which fn() is true.</p>

 <TEXT>
First, what is the exact definition of procedural abstraction?
Second, when we should use a help function in order to achieve tail recursion?when can we achieve tail recursion without help function?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
TWO QUESTIONS RELATED TO RECURSION</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As for your first question, procedural abstraction is "the process of separating ideas from specific instances of those ideas at work." An example would be fprintf(). You could put all the code for printing to the screen in your main function, but that is <em>abstracted </em>away so that you only have to type "fprintf()". Essentially, the users of your code don't need to know how a piece of code does something, they just need to know what it does. This is similar to you being able to drive a car, but not having to know how the car works.</p>

<p>As for the second question, if you need to keep track of more variables than you are allowed to in the recursive function, you need a helper. For example, for the factorial function, you only get int n as an input. The tail recursive version requires that you keep track of the result with every succeeding call, so you have to make a helper function that also has the result as an input.</p></TEXT>

a Makefile is just a file with a bunch of compiler commands and terminal commands. in the file you can tell the compiler to compile anything in the directory and give that compile line a name, or do any terminal command such as making a zip file for auto grader submission. for this project there are two make commands typing in "make p2-tests" will compile all your code properly and make an executable named p2-tests.
so in the terminal all you do once you get in the correct directory is type make p2-tests then hi enter then type ./p2-tests to run your code. 
then the other make command zips up all the files you need to submit to the autograder. if you type "make tar" it will copy the files and compress them. if you look at what is in the directory you should notice a new file ending in .tar and that is the file you submit to the autograder.</TEXT>

<p>I am having trouble with the lab this week with the recursive functions for digit count. Instead of counting and outputting the count of how often a digit appears, my code outputs a 1 for each time the digit appears, and then outputs a sentence about recursion after. For the tail recursive function, I am holding the number of times the digit appears in a special variable I created in a helper function. When I step through my code I see the variable being counted correctly, but for some reason when the stack frames erase and it returns to the tail recursive function, it erases what was held and returns 0. I am not sure where I am going wrong in my code and would appreciated some help. I wasn't sure if I could post code on here, so for now I'll leave it at that explanation. Thanks.</p></TEXT>

<p>So I can see why you're returning zero for the tail recursive version. Your countDigitsTail_helper function returns an int, yet in countDigitsTail, you call "countDigitTail_helper(n, digit, digit_count)" without setting it equal to anything. So, while the call to your helper function returns the correct count, you don't set anything equal to that count, and thus digit_count remains as zero when you return it. In other words, you never actually modified digit_count, so it stays zero in the context of countDigitsTail.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As for your non-tail-recursive function, your base case (checking that n/10 == 0) should return only a single number, not a number + a recursive call. So, if the number is the one you're looking for, you should return just 1, and 0 otherwise. Remember, this is all within the context of your if(n/10==0) statement.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So in countDigitsTail I need to call countDigitsTail_helper as countDigitsTail_helper(int n, int digit, int digit_count)?</p></TEXT>

<p>But when I do that I get a syntax error</p></TEXT>

<p>When I try making the last line of code in countDigitTail to return countDigitTail_helper(n, digit, digit_count) I don't get any output.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I was able to fix the non-tail recursive function, but still not understanding the tail recursive function.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Found the missing return statement. Thanks for your help.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Just to be clear, to use the tail-recursive helper function, your function should look something like this:</p>
<pre>int countDigitsTail(int n, int digit){
  int digit_count = 0;
  digit_count = countDigitTail_helper(n, digit, digit_count);
  return digit_count;
}</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could shorten it to something like this:</p>
<pre>int countDigitsTail(int n, int digit){
  return countDigitTail_helper(n, digit, 0);
}</pre>

 <TEXT>
accumulate function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It sounds like your accumulate function doesn't properly return an int for all possible code paths.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have perhaps a brace balancing issue in p2-tests.cpp. This is sometimes the cause of errors that are supposedly in one location but in actuality are the result of an error elsewhere.</p></TEXT>

<p>If you cant track the bug down, I'd try coming to office hours. We can't promise we will find the bug, but we're pretty good at that sorta stuff.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you call the list_rest(list) on a single element list, does it return a empty list?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
list_rest() function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes. A single element list is composed of that single integer, followed by the empty list - so in this case, the empty list is the rest of the list.</p>

<p>You could also find this out by trying it in your p2-tests.cpp with a single-element list!</p></TEXT>

<p>How would I assert lists like I used assert in tests for sum() and product()? If I just check assert(listA == listB), I get an error and my program ends. Is there another way that I'm supposed to use assert for lists?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
How to use assert() for a list?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Fortunately, there are two functions already implemented for you in p2-tests.cpp: list_equal() and tree_equal(). Both take two parameters (lists and trees, respectively) and return true if and only if their respective parameters are equal. So you can pass the functions two lists or trees, depending on what you're checking, and assert that their return values are true for the parameters you've passed.</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>This is because the compiler doesn't know how to equate listA equal to listB. They aren't primitive data types. It's like if we created a car and we did carA == carB. How do you tell if two cars are equal? (Are they just the same color, or model, or year?) You have to tell the compiler how, and that's what our list_Equal function does.</p></TEXT>

<p>When you append two empty lists, should you be getting (_) or (__) where _ is an empty space? In other words, does appending two empty lists just give you a single empty list, or do you get two empty lists added together (two blank spaces instead of one)?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Appending two empty list</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It should be ( ), with only one space. Think about it this way: a list with two spaces isn't a well-formed list by our definition, since a list is only well-formed if it's the empty list ( ) or an integer followed by a well-formed list. </p>

<p>Another way to think about it is that if you append one list of zero elements to another list of zero elements, you'll still have a list of zero elements - the empty list. </p></TEXT>

<p>When I was testing my iteration of count digits I found an issue with counting 0s. I used 0 to make sure the iteration would stop when the function was on the last digit of the number, so it wouldn't hit an infinite loop. However, now it won't count any 0. If I try to include 0 it hits an infinite loop. I thought about making a special case to see if the digit was 0, but then I feel like I would run into issues if more than one 0 fell in a row in the number. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>// REQUIRES: 0 &lt;= digit &lt;= 9, n &gt;=0<br />// EFFECTS: Returns the number of times "digit" appears in "n".<br />// Uses iteration.<br />int countDigitsIterative(int n, int digit){<br /> int digit_count = 0;<br /> int num_check;<br /> while (n &gt; 0) {<br /> num_check = n % 10;<br /> if (num_check == digit) {<br /> digit_count++;<br /> }<br /> n = n / 10; <br /> }<br /> return digit_count;<br />}</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Issue with 0s</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So you could just add a special case at the beginning that looks like this:</p>
<pre>if(n == 0 &amp;&amp; digit == 0)<br />{<br />    return 1;<br />}</pre>
<p>and then after that continue with your code as normal. The only case that I can see where your code would fail is if you called countDigitsIterative(0, 0). If this is not the case you're referring to, could you explain what other cases your code is failing?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I am still failing iteration if a number with more than one 0 is passed in</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>maybe you should reconsider your base case to be something other than n == 0</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Do I have to account for if 00 is passed in?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I got feedback saying that all of the test cases "failed to compile". I haven't finished the project yet but is this a product of all of the functions testing being buggy or is there another reason why none of them are compiling?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
autograder feedback?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>it could be that you have syntax errors in the functions being  tested so it can't compile. The other potential problem is we are trying to test the functions you haven't written yet and that would be a problem as well becuase calling a function that hasn't been defined is a no no.</p>

<p>Try doing a quick sanity check and make sure that all the functions you have written compile on a caen machine if they don't then fix the errors, if it does we'll look into potential problems</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In your p2.cpp file you only need to #include "p2.cpp" you don't need to include the other libraries or the using namespace std. that might help. </p>

<p>Did you run the command to create a tar file in linux?  You need to make a compressed file that includes p2.cpp p2-test.cpp and group.txt and submit that one tar file to the autograder.</p>

<p>I am a little confused about what you're trying to ask about including other functions though</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You answered my question.  i was just confused what needed to be in p2.cpp.</p>

<p>So on Saturday when I was in BB 1620, when I used make test p2-tests in the terminal, it complied fine.  Now that I am using a different caen computer (in the Ugly) I am getting "multiple definition of `fib(int)" for every single function that I defined.  The only things that is different is that I changes the make file to include group.txt like the announcment said to.  What could cause this?  Is there something that could have loaded on one computer without it loading up on a different one?  I have also looked, the functions are only every declared once, and #include "p2.h" only occurs once.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It sounds like you might have accidentally changed other parts of the Makefile. Because moving to a different CAEN computer should make absolutely no difference because it's still your same profile.</p>

<p>Try compiling without the makefile and just type out the long compile command.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have sent it to the autograder, with all of the function being able to compile on this caen computer, and got failed to complie for each test. </p>

<p>The my p2.cpp is</p>

<p>         #include "p2.h"<br /><br />         #include &lt;iostream&gt;<br />         #include &lt;cassert&gt;<br /><br />         using namespace std;</p>
<p>which is the same as the top of p2-tests.cpp, which should mean all of the functions I created would be in p2.cpp.  I did not include the functions that were all ready defined in p2-tests.cpp which were given to us (thought that if anything not the functions that we were tasked with creating would be included in the test).  Am I confused and have to add functions in p2.cpp? The pdf was not very explicit.</p></TEXT>

Insert Tree</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so you are adding a leaf to the tree you are not finding the existing leafs. the placement of 1 being on the left of 2 is correct because 1 &lt; 2 and the left subtree of 2 is empty so a leaf can be placed there.</p>

<p>for this function you are basically traversing down the tree until you find an empty tree then placing the value in the correct spot.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so a leaf is just any sub tree that has both subtrees empty. so the empty subtree to the left of 2 in this case is technically a leaf it just doesn't hold a value. a leaf can either hold a value like the 3 sub tree of be empty like the sub tree to the left of 2.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The effects clause says "elt inserted at a leaf". Is that just a typo then and its supposed to say "as a leaf"?</p></TEXT>

<p>There's a function that's given to you that does this. Think about the problem in terms of the recursion. Where in the process will you be when you add that element? What comes before? What comes after?</p></TEXT>

Follow-up to filter question:</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>At a glance it looks like you're passing too many arguments into your filter_helper function (see line 152 specifically)</p>

<p>in addition to that you are not passing the function pointer into the function call but rather the result of the function pointer. That is also an issue because it's expecting a function pointer type not a bool which is what the function pointer function returns. Look at the function you declared, how many parameters does it have? that is how many you should pass when calling the function and no more or less.</p></TEXT>

<p>My accumulate function works, but when testing it i realized that the base case returns identity. If identity is 0, the function will work if the function pointer is pointing to add because eventually it will add 0 and end. However, when testing the accumulate function with the pointer pointing to multiply, the answer is always 0 because the base case will eventually multiply by 0. if i change identity to 1, the multiply case works but when the pointer points to the add function the output will be the correct answer plus 1. Not sure how to find a way around this without specifying in my accumulate function whether add or multiply is being passed through.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
accumulate function paradox?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Since identity is one of accumulate's parameters, you need to changed the value passed to identity depending on how you call accumulate. If you call accumulate using an add function as the second parameter, then your third parameter - identity - should be 0. If you call accumulate using a multiply function as the second parameter, then pass identity a value of 1.</p></TEXT>

<p>Do note, though, that while the Effects of the helper and non-helper functions might be similar, the Requires and Modifies clauses could be different.

<p>That's true. I suppose I looked at "updating result" as equivalent to "modifying result", but you have a point since you're right that it is passed by value, not by reference. </p>

 <TEXT>
<p>@ The student response:</p>

<p>Are you sure that a modified clause would be necessary? It's true that the fact_helper function is called with different values of the result argument during the recursion, but that doesn't modify anything in the caller's environment since the argument is always being passed by value.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If a certain parameter needs to start off at a certain value it would be a very good idea to put that in the requires clause. Because in order for your function to work optimally it's REQUIRED to start at a certain value.</p>

Question about contained_by()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes incomplete subtrees should be considered. In your example treeA is contained by treeB.</p>

<p>this example taken from the spec also supports what I said:</p>
<p>tree B</p>
<p>                    4</p>
<p>                  /    \</p>
<p>                /        \</p>
<p>              2          5</p>
<p>             /  \        /  \</p>
<p>                3</p>
<p>               /  \</p>
<p>Tree A</p>
<p>                  4</p>
<p>                 /  \</p>
<p>                /</p>
<p>               2</p>
<p>              /  \</p>

<p>tree A is covered by tree B and therefore contained by tree B even though tree A doesn't have 3 as a right child of 2.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The tree of 2 and 3 is contained by the original tree. In the specs we didn't give you every single tree that is contained by we only gave you some examples so you could get an idea of what it was suppose to do. the 4 and 3 sub tree is not contained by the original tree because it's not a sub tree of the original tree, if the tree was the 4, 2 and 3 sub tree then it would be contained.</p>

<p>As for the original post I think you are misunderstanding something. Covered_by() is going to return true if tree A is either the entire tree B or a sub tree of B, it does NOT need to be a complete subtree of B for it to return true. Basically if you cut out a connected chunk of tree B it will be contained by, so if tree A is a connected chunk of tree B it is contained by tree B.</p>

<p>I can't really explain it better than that without being about to draw pictures so if you are still struggling go to office hours today or tomorrow and we can set you straight.</p></TEXT>

Was it maybe supposed to be open to interpretation?<br /><br />I only bring this up because if it is as you say above, I think I will have to change directions in what I was doing with contained_by() (and I was really excited to be done with that one!)  <br /><br />Additionally, the tree<br /><br /></p>
<p>      3</p>
<p>    /    \</p>
<p>  1      6<br /><br />is neither tree B nor a complete subtree of B, and we could not say a complete subtree of B will always be equivalent to B, as the OP was referring to, unless I am misunderstanding something....</p>
<p><br />Any further clarification that could be provided would be appreciated.  Thanks!</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>look in the follow up discussion section of @250</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The identity is used in the base case.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Say we have some operation x that does some thing (could be addition, multiplication, division, etc.). Say we also have a number <em>y </em>that we want to perform operation x on. The identity <em>i</em> is some number such that <em>y</em> x <em>i</em> = <em>y.</em> For addition, the identity is 0 because any number <em>a</em> added to zero is <em>a</em>. Multiplication has an identity of 1 because any number <em>a</em> multiplied by 1 is equal to <em>a</em>. This property is why the identity is used as a base case in recursive functions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So it returns the result of the function is that correct?</p>
<p>so if add was our function, it would return the product of add?</p></TEXT>

<p>On the specs for P2, it says fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1.  Does this mean 0 is the 0th Fibonacci number, 1 is the first, 1 is the second, 2 is the third, 3 is the fourth, and so on?  Or is 0 the first element in the Fibonacci and so on?  I know the sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, and so on.  But in writing fib, when n = 3, I don't know whether the third Fibonacci number should be 1 or 2.</p></TEXT>

<p>The different test cases test different functions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>7 out of 8 test cases for just the sum function or all functions?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Never assume that your code is correct. Test every edge case you can think of, and then test it some more. If after all that, the autograder still says you have a bug, I would contact the course staff and inquire about what the test case is actually testing.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok so I had a 3 out of the 16 possible functions not included in my p2.cpp.  If the autograder is testing for one of the 3 functions will it say fail?  Also, sorry if I sound like I'm trying to exploit the autograder.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you have not implemented a skeleton function for the three you haven't written, then the autograder will not compile. If you *have* implemented a skeleton function, then it will compile but fail. Just to be clear, a skeleton function is something like this:</p>
<pre>int func(int inputA, int inputB)<br />{<br />    return 0;<br />}</pre>
<p>Essentially, a skeleton function doesn't do anything, it's just there to get things to compile.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For the future, do skeleton functions require the same function name or do they require both the same function name and same type signature?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The latter. They also require you to return the right type (which is why the skeleton function in the example returns 0: the type signature requires that an int is returned).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If the autograder is saying my sum function failed test case 1a, then it is bugged based on my opinion that my sum function is fine.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>the second, to my knowledge the 8 test cases are for separate functions so you autograder doesn't test all the functions you have to write for the project which is why we are stressing writing your own tests.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm a bit confused. Does the autograder test all functions within the 8 test cases or does it only reveal the results of a few of the test cases for some functions?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>*Do we have to write RMEs for test cases?</p>

no you don't need rme for test functions and you can test your functions however you want as long as it tests the functions correctly</TEXT>

<p>I'm using EECS 280 Labster for lab 2.</p>

<p>For the Tail Recursive version of the countDigits function, I am using a helper function with an extra parameter to count the number of digits. However, EECS280 Labster responds saying that I used countDigitsTail_Helper() without declaring it. However, when I do declare it, it states that "countDigitsTail_Helper cannot be declared more than once in this scope". When I put the same code into a C++ file then compile on my own computer and run, it works perfectly.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>I had this problem too. It was because I had my helper function underneath the countDigitsTail. Labster apparently has issues if it finds a function it hasn't come across when going top to bottom. I fixed it by simply moving my helper function above it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In both Labster and regular C++, you do have to order things from top to bottom to make sure they are declared before being used. However, Labster isn't yet able to handle separate declarations and definition of functions, so that is why adding the additional declaration works in normal C++ but not in Labster.  Sorry for the inconvenience!</p></TEXT>

<p>The list-processing functions given to us will throw exceptions in certain cases where you violate their "requires" clauses. I don't know exactly the problem in your case, but this means that you tried to use a list-processing function on an empty list when you shouldn't have.</p>

<p>Hi, I finished my tail recursion for countDigits both in the CAEN environment and the the labster and it runs perfectly. The only problem is that in the Labster, even if the function is tail-recursive, the memory display on the left still changes like the regular recursion, while the iteration re-use the storage of the stack frame. </p>

<p>Then I doubt if I was not writing a correct tail recursion. Then I tried to put the factorial tail recursion example in the lecture notes into Labster and then, it also runs like regular recursion without re-using the storage of the stack frame. Thus, I believe that there is some issues with the Labster whose memory display shows incorrectly.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>

<p>What should we return if a list contains one element?</p>

<p>for example if a list = (7);</p>
<p>what should the product of the list return?</p>
<p>sum?</p>

<p>thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
product or sum of list containing one number</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If your list is ( 7 ), then your list is really composed of 7 and the empty list. The Requires clause of sum() has that you should return 0 if the list is empty, so the sum of the list is 7 + 0.</p>

<p>The Requires clause of product() has that you should return 1 if the list is empty, so the product of the list is 7 * 1.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>it all depends on what function you pass into the accumulate function, if you pass a function that adds two numbers then it should act just like the sum function. but if your parameter function does something different it should act accordingly</p></TEXT>

<p>what about for accumulate? would the accumulation of the list be 7?</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi, I was wondering if there is a way to test if a function is tail recursive.  I currently have almost all of them done, but some of them I am unsure of if they are tail recursive when other within them.</p>

<p>For example, if within functionA I return FunctionB(FunctionA), is this still tail recursive if B isn't tail recursive, and what if it is?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Tail Recursion test</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If B is recursive, and it calls a tail-recursive A, then B is not tail recursive. If B is tail-recursive, and calls a tail-recursive A within it, then it is still tail-recursive. If B is the function sum() and A is the function sum_helper, within B, you are going to call return A. In this case, B is indeed tail recursive. </p>

<p>Put another way, if you have any operations in the return statement that are completed after a function call, then the function is not tail recursive (think something like return 1 + A(some_inputs))</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't know of any easy ways of checking that a function is tail-recursive.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>look at your code, is it possible that you are doing any other stuff after you make the recursive call. If you're not then it's tail recursive</p></TEXT>

<p>Is there still a way to check if the frames are being removed from the stack and the recursion is indeed tail recursion?</p>

<p>I just wrote a function and a helper function (both tail recursive) to calculate and return the length of a list. When I place these two functions inside p2.cpp and call the length function in p2-tests.cpp, it says that my length function hasn't been declared. Does this mean that functions that I write myself, which are not helper functions to the already-declared sum(), product(), reverse(), etc. functions, should be written and declared in p2-tests.cpp and not p2.cpp?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Where to place custom functions I write</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Basically, yes: p2.h is the file that links the function implementations of p2.cpp to p2-tests.cpp, and p2-tests.cpp can only "see" the functions declared in p2.h, which is why if you try to call any of your helper functions from p2.cpp in main() you'll get the same error. If you want to use your list length function to help implement some of the recursive functions in p2.cpp, then put it in p2.cpp, but if you want to use it for testing purposes then put it in p2-tests.cpp. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Depends on where you're using them. If you're only #including the p2.h and recursive.h files, then any extra functions you put in p2.cpp (i.e. the ones *not* declared in p2.h) will not be usable in any other file. Now, if you were to declare the function in p2-tests.cpp, and then define it in p2.cpp, then it should compile and run fine. The problem you're having is that p2-tests.cpp doesn't know that your function exists, and so when you call it, it freaks out because it can't find the definition (i.e. it doesn't think it has been declared). If you were to declare the function in p2-tests.cpp, then the compiler would look through all the .cpp files you've linked together in your compile line to find the definition.</p></TEXT>

<p>Example of testing the sum function:</p>
<p>You create a list that you have made carefully so as to test certain functionality of your code. You then figure out (usually by hand) what the result of calling sum on that list would be. You call sum on said list and store the value. You then check if the result of calling sum(list) is the same as the expected value, or if it's different. If they're the same, then you passed the test.</p>

<p>In general, you make a list or tree that will test certain functionality (i.e. inserting into a very specific spot in a tree when a function is called). You figure out what the result would be, then call whatever function you're testing on that tree or list. You check what your program gave as the answer against what you know the answer should be. If they're the same, you passed the test. If not, you failed the test. It's a good idea to output whether you passed or failed the test case.</p></TEXT>

The Great Labster Bug Hunt</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Notable reports from this past week include:</p>
<ul><li>Compound assignment operators working incorrectly</li><li>do...while loops don't work</li><li>ternary operator doesn't work</li><li>unary minus operator doesn't work (lol that's embarrassing)</li><li>break statements don't work</li><li>mouse wheel doesn't work across platforms</li><li>pressing tab changes edit focus rather than expected formatting functionality</li></ul>

<p>Most of these have been fixed on the development version and will be pushed to live sometime this weekend.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Good news!  I've implemented auto run and given the Labster editor a makeover to use the CodeMirror framework.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>(Those aren't on the live version yet, though.)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes! Thanks so much best improvement ever! </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I wish tab actually tabbed in like you said.</p>

<p>And auto run,  auto run,  umm did I say auto run? Usually I don't need to step through my code and I would rather not have to manually click step forward each time. Auto run please Hahaha. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Likewise, += is turned into =.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, these are the compound assignment operators.  They should be fixed when I push my changes to live. :)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The expression "n /= 2" is turned into "n = 2"</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Line numbers are a good idea.  I'm also going to make it highlight syntax errors somewhat similarly to the way it underlines semantic issues so that you don't have to track down a line and character number.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Line numbers and highlighting for the line with a syntax error done.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Would be great to have line numbers.</p>
<p>Make an option to straight up execute the entire code.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Mouse wheel was pretty buggy over different web browsers/environments/trackpads, but it should be improved soon.  I've switched to using the jquery mousewheel plugin on the development version, which is supposed to handle some compatibility issues as well as normalizing scrolling behavior somewhat.</p>

<p>The single click on the file name thing was sort of a band-aid fix after I realized with the original behavior it was really easy to accidentally overwrite your code if you clicked them again.  The inconveniences of how it works now will probably go away whenever I do a larger overhaul of how keeping track of different "files" works.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't think its bad that you have different tabs, it makes bouncing between the two easier and beside you don't really need both of them at the same time, you just need to change the webpage's header when you select a file. I don't know much HTML or whatever you used to code the webpage but hopefully it won't be alot of trouble. This is all assuming you're sticking with this for the labs, if you are think about a way to submit this without using CTools. Great work.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ah ha...I didn't quite catch what you were saying earlier about changing the page's title.  That's pretty easy to do, and I'm fairly sure all modern browsers are fine with the title changing dynamically without needing a page refresh.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hi James, on Linux Red Hat using Firefox you can't switch between files on the left hand side so you have to open a new tab for a new file, not really a problem but maybe you can change the name of the Tab to the file name to make things easier to read. I'm sure everyone has been requesting this but maybe add a fast forward mode that quickly runs through the code for as long as you hold the button or until you pause depending on whichever can be coded in. Great program, I always run linux but I can see people who use VNC really love you for letting them complete the lab in a not so laggy environment.</p>
<p>--EDIT-- I didn't know about the mouse wheel feature because It doesn't work for me, and the break statements have been reported.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I noticed this as well. Even the factorial example for tail recursion created a large stack frame.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The compiler for Labster only works to the extent that I've written it, and unfortunately right now that doesn't include doing the compiler optimization.  For now, we can at least observe that the stack frames are in fact redundant and the optimization could be made.  Labster still handles "tail recursion" correctly, but it is fair to say it doesn't do the related compiler optimization.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't think you implemented a correct tail recursive function Anon and Harrison. Tail recursion runs without creating any large stack whatsoever.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In Labster it still pushes on all the stack frames, because it doesn't do the compiler optimization we've mentioned in lecture.  Doing that is conceptually separate from tail recursion, although the fact tail recursion lets you do the optimization is one of the major reasons tail recursion is good.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>One thing I noticed is that the step-by-step stack frame does not seem to be accurate for tail recursion (at least from what we learned in class). In class we learned that, if written correctly, tail recursion allows one to reuse a single stack frame.</p>

<p>When I tried to view tail recursion on the step-by-step stack frame, it created a new stack frame for each recursive call, even if there was no work to be done after the call. I expected the single stack frame to be reused.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how you work the compiler for labster, but I remember Professor DeOrio saying that one needs to use the O2 optimization in order to get the full advantage of tail recursion.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for putting together such a nice way to view stack memory management. It's been a very helpful tool.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This is an interesting one!  It turns out the C++ language does allow you to return a void, although you probably don't want to do it.  I think the major reason it's allowed is so as not to conflict with some of the ways in which you could write templated code (we'll see more about templates later in the course).  Labster doesn't handle this correctly - I'll make sure to add in a fix in the next version.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Fixed.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>One thing I noticed is that I cannot return a void function, and I can do that in my project. It seems like Labster is confused because I'm returning a void function and thinks it's some number.</p>

<p>So</p>

<p>void someRecursiveFunction()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>    // some code</p>
<p>     return someRecursiveFunction();</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>has to be written as</p>

<p>void someRecursiveFunction()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>    // some code</p>

<p>    someRecursiveFunction();</p>
<p>    return;</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>I have done the first one before in g++ with no issues!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I can probably get this fixed without too much trouble.  When I originally wrote Labster's language grammar, I left out the ternary operator because it requires some special attention during parsing because of its unique precedence rules.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13681293/how-can-i-incorporate-ternary-operators-into-a-precedence-climbing-algorithm" target="_blank">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13681293/how-can-i-incorporate-ternary-operators-into-a-precedence-climbing-algorithm</a></p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Fixed a while ago, btw. :)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ternary operator does not work, it breaks everything.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, and the farther you are into the execution of a program, the longer it takes.  This is a fundamental issue with the way a few things are implemented and will take a larger overhaul of Labster to fix.  Not sure when I'll get to it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Clicking "step back" button will cause program to slow down considerably. Using Chrome, don't think it's a browser issue though.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It looks like the n-- still works correctly but just shows the wrong thing.  I tracked down part of the display code where I'd forgotten to change to "--" instead of "++".</p>

<p>I think the second thing you noticed is partially just one of the less intuitive behaviors of C++. The order in which subexpressions are evaluated is often not specified, so that something like what you're seeing might happen. Everything should still print out in the correct order. (If it doesn't, then there is a bug I'm missing somewhere.)</p>

<p>These things said, the hailstoneRecursive function from the lab returns void and technically Labster should be giving a compile error if you try to cout it, but it doesn't due to a different bug (sort of).  Since it shouldn't even be compiling, Labster blindly tries to cout it and crashes.  So this is probably what's going on - it didn't exactly skip the first parts of your cout sequence, and it would print them out in order, but it decided to evaluate the function call before doing the printing and then when it tried to print the void, it crashed before it could do the other stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks!  Will be fixed soon.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>n-- was changed to n++ when the code was ran.</p>

<p>When I wrote</p>

<p>cout &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; hailstoneRecursive(2*n);</p>

<p>it skipped over the n and the " ", moving straight to hailstoneRecursive(2*n)</p>

<p>When I wrote it in this supposedly equivalent form</p>

<p>cout &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; " ";</p>

<p>cout &lt;&lt; hailstoneRecursive(2*n);</p>

<p>then it worked just fine. This could just be my error, not Labster's, but I have never encountered a problem using a single cout, as opposed to splitting it into two different statements.</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, Labster just ignores const at the moment.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Have you done stuff with const yet? I think maybe it's being ignored so far (it might be one of those things that's weirdly hard not to ignore). I noticed someone in my lab didn't need to use const in const int *ptr = row, and when I remembered that I tested out this code, which runs and compiles fine with a final i value of 2.
int wheee(int i){
 	i = i + 1;
  return i;
}
int main(){
  const int i = 0;
  i = i + 1;
  i = wheee(i);
  cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
}</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm having trouble writing the reverse function.</p>
<p>I have the logic down and it's all written in the helper function.</p>
<p>However, the helper function won't let me implement the extra variable as a list_t and then return that list to the main function.</p>
<p>I guess my main question is, how  can I return a list to the calling function from the helper function?</p>

<p>int reverse_help(list_t list, list_t listA)<br />{<br />    list_t listA_make();<br />    while (!list_isEmpty(list))<br />    {<br />        list_make(list_first(list), listA);<br />        list = list_rest(list);<br />    }<br />return listA;<br />}<br /><br />list_t reverse(list_t list)<br />{<br />    return reverse_help(list, ??);<br />}</p>

List Reverse Function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
next time you are posting code make sure it's a private question, otherwise it's technically code sharing. I changed the question to private
<p>In your helper function, you define the return type to be int but what you actually returned is a list_t. You need to ensure the data structure you returned is the same with what you declared.</p>
<p>By the way, the procedures, including the list reverse function should be tail recursive. You can refer to the appendix of the spec for more information about tail recursive and helper functions.</p></TEXT>

<p>1. Your helper function need to be tail recursive.</p>
<p>2. You need to pass a variable in accordance with the type you declared  (list_t here) when you call the helper function.  </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I apologize for that.<br />Ok so i have to change the return type to list_t, that makes sense to me.<br />Two more follow up questions:</p>
<p>1. Do the helper functions have to be tail recursive also? I thought the purpose of the helper function was to allow us to use a while, but then only return the helper function in the actual function?</p>
<p>2. Since in my helper function, the second variable which I made is a list type, in my actual function how do I call that type. In my example above, I wrote two "??" because I am unsure of how to replace it.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>One possible explanation I can think of is that you are probably accessing tree_t without using the tree interface provided.</p>
<p>For example, did you use tree_make to create empty/new tree?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It is hard to find out where is wrong without the actual code. Since you should not share code on piazza, my suggestions would be:</p>
<p>1. Make this a private post and show the part of code that's resulting the error;</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>2. You can go to any of the office hours and ask the GSIs/IAs in person. I am currently holding office hours in 1695 BBB.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, I did that last statement to catch that specific case.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The case countDigits(0,0) is the tricky one :).  See if you can figure out a way to do it.  As a hint, consider using a different base case than n=0, because once n turns into zero you have a problem. You can't distinguish between getting to 0 by dividing something else by 10 (in which case it's not one of the digits and you shoudn't count it) and getting to 0 because n started at 0, in which case it is a real digit.</p>

<p>Or you can always just handle n=0, digit=0 as a special case.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>or is a legitimate attempt accepted? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
are we graded on accuracy for labs</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The labs are graded for completion, and not necessarily for accuracy.

<p>The front page of each lab contains a section with completion criteria and a checklist to give you an idea of what we look for when grading them.</p></TEXT>

<p>Should we return an empty list if an empty list is passed into these functions?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
filter_even/odd: empty list</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes. If the list has no elements, there's nothing to filter.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes the functions are suppose to return an in original order list of the elements that are either even or odd, so if there is nothing in a list then there is nothing to filter. that being said if you have a list of only even ints and you pass it through filter odd you should also return an empty list.</p></TEXT>

<p>I tried testing negative inputs for this function and it failed. I tried reading up on previous posts about this from the rotate function, I found that when a negative number is assigned to an unsigned int, the positive result may not be the corresponding value of the negative number. Is that why my assertions are failing for this? And if that's the case, is that not something i can account for because it may violate the Requires clause that n must not be greater than elements in the first list?</p></TEXT>

<p>I understand Tail-Recursion and I've been implementing it for a certain function in Project 2 and got a correct and working function that returns the correct output.</p>

<p>However, I'm a bit worried that it isn't tail-recursive, and wanted some input. <br />I'm posting a very general, random code that has no relation to this project, but has the same issue that makes me wonder if it really is tail-recursive.</p>

<pre>int Helper(int n, int m) {
	if (n == 0) {
		return 0;
	}
	else {
		return Helper(n - 1, m + Helper(n - 1, 0);
}
int RandomFunction(int n) {
	return Helper(n, 0);
}</pre>

<p>I know Tail-Recursion is obvious when a function utlilizes "return [code]" and that's it, no other math..</p>
<p>But in this case, for this particular line:<br /><br /></p>
<pre>		return Helper(n - 1, m + Helper(n - 1, 0);</pre>
<p>The return statement calls Helper, which calls <strong>itself</strong> <strong>again </strong>for one of its variables. In this case, I'm not too sure how stacks would work here (knowing that Tail-Recursion = 1 stack only). </p>

<p>So two questions:<br />1) is this tail - recursive?</p>
<p>if not</p>
<p>2) is this valid for a function in project 2? (Meaning, if this isn't 1 stack but instead 2 stacks... is that okay?)</p>

<p>Thanks.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>No it can't be tail recursion, after the inside recursive call there is still more work to be done. Not only do you have to add 3 to the inside call to get the value to pass into the outside function call (which is still considered even more work). Go back to the slides about tail recursion and look at the differences between normal recursion and tail recursion.</p></TEXT>

What's the deal with the countDigits base case?</TEXT>

<p>I feel like you can assume that no number is gonna start with 0 (or a string of 0s).</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>I'm not sure how others approached it, but here's my take: if a (non-negative) number has only one digit, then it must be less than 10. No matter what number you're given, if you keep slicing off one digit from the end, the last thing you'll end up with is a one-digit number from 0 to 9. And when you're left with a number less than 10, you can just check whether or not that number is equal to the digit you're searching for.</p>

<p>I hope that helps!!</p></TEXT>

How do we determine whether or not an instance of tail recursion requires a helper function?  I know it often does but there have also been cases where we don't.  What's the logic in determining its necessity?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Helper function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Usually when a function requires extra parameter(s) to perform as wanted, like if you need an extra variable to keep track of the value you want to return in your recursive function. For example, in the list_t sum (list_t list) function, we are only allowed to pass one argument to sum(list_t list). It wouldn't be possible to make this function recursive unless we were allowed to pass more arguments (particularly a variable that helps us keep track of the sum of each element in the list).  </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Copying in an answer from previous terms I use when this question comes up:</p>

<p>The reason we often see a helper function with tail recursion is directly tied to the extra parameter needed to pass the partially accumulated result from one recursive call to the next.  Because the initial call to this should be provided the identity for the particular problem, it would be annoying to have to type it in every time if we just added the extra parameter to the original function.  Thus, we add a helper function with the extra argument, but the original function keeps the same prototype and essentially serves as a shell that calls the helper function with the identity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, to your question, what we need to consider whether there's ever a case in which we don't need the extra parameter (and thus not need the helper function).  The obvious case is when we don't have a result to accumulate - the hailstoneRecursive function from the lab is one example, because we're just printing the values of the function as we go along.  If we instead wanted to put the values into a list or add them up, we'd need the extra parameter to hold the growing list or accumulating sum, respectively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's also possible that we're accumulating the result in some other fashion than by passing it as a parameter.  The first way that comes to mind is a global variable.  But global variables are evil.  It's also possible that the function in question is a member function of an object (we'll learn about objects later in the course), and in that case we could use a member variable as the accumulator.  Both of these approaches are somewhat awkward and I can't off the top of my head think of any reason you'd ever want to write code this way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, in some cases we just don't need the accumulator. An example of this would be the following tail recursive function to calculate the greatest common divisor using Euclid's method.</p>
<p> </p>
<pre>int gcd(int a, int b){
  if(b == 0){
    return a;
  }
  else{
    return gcd(b, a mod b);
  }
}
</pre>
<p>In recursion, our strategy is always to find a way to solve a problem by finding a way to reduce it to a simpler self-similar subproblem.  In some cases we need to make a modification to the result of the subproblem.  For example, we know that sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) = 1 + sum([2, 3, 4]).  Adding one is the modification here.  In other cases, the answer is simply the same as the subproblem, with no modifications made.  For example, we know that gcd(12, 8) = gcd(8, 4).  In essence, this is the property that allows us to get away without the extra parameter and consequentially without the helper function.<br /><br />Interestingly, there are crafty things we can do to reformulate some problems in this way.  The goal here is to have a subproblem to solve that has the same result as our original problem - no modification to the result need to be made.  But we <em>are</em> allowed to modify the subproblem itself!  That is, we can pick our subproblem in a more crafty way than just taking the obvious one.  This probably makes no sense right now, so here's an example.  If we look back at the sum problem, we were originally going to solve sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) by doing 1 + sum([2, 3, 4]).  sum([2, 3, 4]) is the obvious subproblem to choose, but it's not required.  So, let's make a deal with the devil and do this: sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) = sum([2+1, 3, 4]) = sum([3, 3, 4]).  Instead of doing the +1 modification to the result, we just sneak it into a modification to the subproblem, which in this case means adding +1 to the first element in the remaining list because we know that's equivalent for this particular problem.  Eventually we'd get down to sum([3, 3, 4]) = sum([6, 4]) = sum([10]) = 10.  Because we don't have any modification to be made to the result, we don't need the extra accumulator parameter!  Mwahahaha!  (Another equivalent but less exciting way to look at it is that we're basically using the first element of the list as an accumulator instead.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
<p>Sometimes we don't need a helper function - when we don't need to accumulate a result, either because there's nothing to accumulate (e.g. just printing to cout) or because we can avoid accumulation by luck (the subproblem we naturally reduce to has the same answer with no modification needed) or by clever design (we purposefully reduce to a subproblem with the same answer)..</p></TEXT>

I know how to make directories and change directories, but am not sure in what order I should do everything. Can someone please outline the steps for me? I still need to transfer my local files to CAEN (via sftp). It's okay if you break down the steps as if I'm stupid (meaning literally step by step)....I won't be offended. </p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>If your insert_list function has a return statement that isn't tail-recursive or recursive at all, then it does not meet the specs and you will not get points for it being tail-recursive. All your list functions must be tail-recursive themselves, not just use tail-recursive functions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It sounds like you're using some of the other functions you've already written as "helpers".  That's fine.  Even though it might mean your insert_list techincally isn't recursive at all (it doesn't actually call itself ever) and thus not tail recursive, all the work is happening in your other functions acting as helpers and they are tail recursive.  The spirit of the requirement is just that you can't use loops and any recursive calls you make must be tail recursive calls.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi, I'm trying to understand how to use tree_make, and was trying to see if someone could help me build the tree on the example page. </p></TEXT>

How to make the example tree in the traversal example</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm assuming you are referring to this tree:</p>
<pre>           4
          / \
         /   \
        2     5
       / \   / \
          3
         / \</pre>
<p>The tree_make function can take one of two sets of inputs. If no inputs are passed into the function an empty tree is created. Otherwise, you pass in three inputs: int elt, tree_t left, and tree_t right.</p>

<p>This essentially means that you specify the integer at the top of the tree and then the trees that are beneath the tree (hence tree_t being a recursively defined type - it references itself.)</p>

<p>To create the above tree you would begin at the bottom and build upward. The entire tree can be built in one line of code, but the parenthesis can get overwhelming when there are several subtrees being added together. To make it a bit easier to write (and read) it's best to define the subtrees and append them into the larger tree.</p>

<p>Let's define subTree1 which will become the left subtree of the final tree:</p>
<pre>tree_t subTree1 = tree_make(2, tree_make(), tree_make(3, tree_make(), tree_make()));</pre>
<p>Which when viewed is</p>
<pre>  2

<pre>tree_t subTree2 = tree_make(5, tree_make(), tree_make());</pre>

<p>We can now define our final tree as the final node (4) and our two subtrees as its left and right subtrees:</p>

<p>Is there any faster way that I may be missing, however? It seems that, to input numbers into list, you have to use a for loop or redundant code over and over (for a case of ListA = ( 0, 3, 7, -3, 2, 99), in which there is no order).</p>

<p>so you need to add the current element and also the left subtree element and the right subtree element, and soon on all the way down the tree.</p>

<p>Start with your base case. If you get to an empty tree, what should happen?</p>

<p>Another thing is this does not have to be tail recursive. You can have pending computation, which you'll need because you are adding.

<p>I finished my project several days ago, but came across a follow-up discussion @452 on Piazza that made me question my solution to insert_list. </p>

<p>I wrote a function to determine the length of the list and performed the following operations on the list to insert:</p>

<pre>list_t insert_list(list_t first, list_t second, unsigned int n)
{
	int firstLength = list_length(first, 0);
	first = rotate(first, n);
	first = append(first, second);
	first = rotate(first, firstLength - n);
	return first;
}</pre>
<p>This properly inserts second n spaces into first. All of the functions called are tail recursive.</p>

<p>However, according to the followup discussion I linked above, this solution is not considered tail recursive because the function itself is not recursive. To remedy this, I went ahead and essentially did the exact steps above but with a helper function instead of append.</p>

<p>The insert_list_helper function was identical to the append_helper, but on the return I rotated the created list to mimic the last operation in my above code. This seemed unnecessary to me, as I had already written this helper function for append.

<p>Hello! I've spent a long while trying to get the traversal function to work properly. Here is what I have (hopefully I was successfully able to make this a private question): </p>
<pre>/*
// REQUIRES: final is an empty list
*/
list_t traversal_helper(tree_t tree, list_t returnMe) {
   if (!tree_isEmpty(tree)) {
      traversal_helper(tree_left(tree), returnMe);
      returnMe = list_make(tree_elt(tree), returnMe);
      traversal_helper(tree_right(tree), returnMe);<br />   }
   return returnMe;
}
list_t traversal(tree_t tree) {
   list_t returnMe = list_make();
   return reverse(traversal_helper(tree, returnMe));
}</pre>
<p>I've combed it over with a debugger countless times and what seems to be happening is that the elements are stored properly on the way down the left hand side, but on the way up, nodes/elements are deleted and everything is removed from the list returnMe. Then the top most element is stored in the list successfully, the list is created properly on the way down the right side, but on the way up the right-side, the right-side elements are deleted from the list like they were on the left so that with any test case only the top most element is stored in the list.</p>

<p>Is this something I should bring to office hours rather than a private Piazza question? Any ideas? Thank you!</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Tree Traversal deletes data on the way up</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>traversal_helper returns a list. In your if statement, you do not set anything equal to the list that is returned, so it isn't actually stored anywhere. What you should be doing is creating a left_list (that stores the result of the first traversal_helper function call), appending that to tree_elt, and then appending that whole thing to the result of the last function call to traversal_helper. </p>

<p>As a side note, it is helpful when thinking about traversal to think of the tree solely as left_tree -- elt -- right_tree. So the way you want to write traversal is such that you return the left subtree (as a list) appended to the elt appended to the right subtree (also as a list). </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>traversal_helper returns a list. In your if statement, you do not set anything equal to the list that is returned, so it isn't actually stored anywhere.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That line makes a list from tree_elt (which is just one element) and the value returnMe has in the current stack frame. The trouble is, returnMe isn't holding the list that was returned to this function; it's holding the list that was passed to this function. When you call</p>
<pre>traversal_helper(tree_left(tree), returnMe);</pre>
<p>you create a <strong>copy</strong> of returnMe for that stack frame. You then do some operations on it in that stack frame, and eventually return. When you return, that copy of returnMe vanishes. Yes, you're using it as your return value, but you're not assigning that return value to anything. Also, nothing you do to the copy of returnMe in that stack frame affects the <strong>original</strong> returnMe. And that original returnMe is the one you're using in the call to list_make that you mentioned above. </p>
<p>The solution, as Alyssa suggested, is to set something equal to the return value of traversal_helper, e.g.,</p>
<pre>list_t my_list = traversal_helper(tree_left(tree), returnMe);</pre>
<p>Now the list you built in your recursive call is accessible in the frame that made the call. </p>

<p>So far, i have my traversal function check if the tree to the left is empty and until it isn't it checks again. when it gets to the left most tree it returns that element.

<p>thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Traversal Help</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Notice that the return value of traversal is list_t, rather than a single element. For any given element, you want to return the left subtree (as a list), appended to that element, appended to the right subtree (also as a list). If you append them all together, you get one big list_t. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You would return a subtree as a list via the same method as returning the entire tree as a list. Same for the right subtree. This is where recursion comes in.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Traversal returns a list. So, when you call traversal on the the left subtree you should assume that it will return a list traversal of the left tree, and traversal on the right subtree will return a list of the right subtree.
So, given that information, think about how would you merge together those two lists with the current tree elt in order to get the proper final list.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What do you mean by returning the left or right subtree as a list? I get how to return the left subtree as a tree but not as a list.</p></TEXT>

<p>When is your list going back to being empty? Is it after your recursive call returns? If that's the case, your problem may be that you aren't assigning the return value from your recursive call to a variable in the calling function. Remember, when you pass a variable by value to your recursive function, you make a copy of that variable for each stack frame. Modifications to the copy in one stack frame won't modify the copy in the stack frame above it, even if both copies of the variable have the same name. </p></TEXT>

It's hard to tell exactly what's going on without code, but from a quick google search this implies trying to access a value on a non existent object. For example if you tried accessing the element (tree_elt() or list_elt()) of an empty tree or list.<div><br /></div><div>We tought you how to use the gnu debugger (gdb) in lab01 I would suggest you step through your code to see where it happens to give you a place in your code to look for issues.

<p>I made a covered by function before starting contained by, but I get an error when compiling this. If I define it in p2-tests then it functions fine, but if I define it in p2.cpp it shoots out an error. My guess is this is due to covered by not being in any of the header functions. Should I be adding it to any of the given files such as p2.h? Otherwise I don't know how to use it in contained_by since that will be in p2.cpp</p></TEXT>

<p>did you declare it as static in p2.cpp? That will limit its scope to the file it was declared in, meaning you couldn't call it outside p2.cpp. If it's static and you want to test it in a different file, you can just remove the static modifier for now and make sure to add it back for what you submit.</p></TEXT>

<p>just declare and define the whole thing in p2-test.cpp and testing it there. That is much safer than changing p2.h and forgetting to change it back and forgetting to make the original function static in p2.cpp</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
To double check your tar, copy it into a separate folder and check that the command "tar -xzvf submit.tar.gz" unpacks the three required files. Most of the errors I have seen with this are due to students taring a directory containing the files instead of just taring the files.</TEXT>

What do you mean include? Are you using the Makefile we gave you? </TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you should never #include a cpp file, The only thing that should be #include in the p2-tests should be p2.h. If you wrote all your helper functions as static and filled in the functions we tell you to write in p2.cpp then everything should compile fine. In your p2.cpp double check that you #include "p2.h" .

Insert_tree: what if elt already exists in the tree?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Recall that one of the requirements for a sorted binary tree is that the right subtree is a sorted binary tree, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than or equal to the top element of the tree. So if you're trying to insert A but already have found A at a node, then you have to follow the right branch of A and reevaluate where A should be based on the value of the new node.</p>

<p>So it's definitely possible for a sorted binary tree to have duplicate elements. Taking a look at the spec, one of the examples of a sorted binary tree is:</p>
<pre> 1

     2

<p>Is it still considered regular recursive if we use helper functions. I always thought that only tail recursive functions are only allowed to have helper functions?

Helper Function for regular recursion functions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The difference between regular recursion and tail recursion has to do with the number of stack frames created during recursive calls - not the presence of helper functions.</p>

Look at the RME for the accumulate function in the spec. There is an example of how to call the function in the effects clause.

stress tests</TEXT>

you should stress test everything all the time. so what if your test program runs for a minute. do be careful about stress testing trees though. if you make too bog of a test case you could run into stack over flow (not the website bit the actual error) but your tail recursive ones should be just fine.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>anything that will stress the program, this usually means passing in very large values into the function, like calling the Fibonacci function and passing in 50 to find the 50th number in the sequence. Yes picking a value to pass in is arbitrary, just choose something that would be large</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't think fib 50 would work because the number would be too large. At around fib(47) is the highest number you can get I think?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so technically it still works but interger overflow becomes an issue so you don't get the actual answer without doing some math of un-overflowing the int. The point is you function should still work with the the worst case and very high work loads</p></TEXT>

<p>but both of you were able to successfully submit the project? If one of you isn't on the class list of the autograder then it would be a problem</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I am having the same problem. I was able to submit my p1 to the auto grader and I worked on it by myself as well. When we submit p2, the auto grader only emails my partner, and not me.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>are you sure that you spelled your partner's name correctly?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes. Both our uniqnames are spelled right, separated by one space.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>did you spell the file name correctly?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah it's just called group.txt</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I've got nothing then, bring your code to some office hours and have a GSI take a look at your files</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>thanks for your help I got it resolved. It was not happy with me making the .txt with textEdit for some reason.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>We both did project 1 seperately so there was no joint submission.</p></TEXT>

<p>Will project 3 be released today?</p></TEXT>

<p>For the test file p2-test.cpp that we will be turning in, should we be writing multiple individual test cases for each function that we wrote? Or should we instead be writing one test function for every function, which we would then pass different cases into?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
p2-tests.cpp</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Writing one testing function per recursive function, and then passing in different cases to those testing functions, will save you a lot of code (and probably also a lot of confusion).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My partner and I write P2.CPP independently but work on test together.</p>
<p>SO can my partner and I submit different p2.cpp but same test.cpp?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Can I have different p2.cpp but same test with partner ?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you are working with a partner you should be working on the project together, not just working on the testing together. That begin said you only should submit one project to the autograder, because we will only grade the last submit to the autograder. So if both of you submit a different p2.cpp file we will only grade the one submitted last.</p></TEXT>

<p>in the lecture, we are given a function like following:</p>

<p>int strlen(char *s) {</p>
<p>char *p = s;</p>
<p>while (*p) ++p;</p>
<p>return p - s;</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>don't we add a * in front of p-s .</p>
<p>like *(p-s), since p-s is like an address</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
quick question about a function in lecture.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So arrays are continuous memory meaning that all the elements in it are right next to each other in memory. So this function gets a pointer to end of the array p and you have a pointer to the start of the array s. So if you subtract the memory address from the end and the memory address of the beginning you get the size of the array.</p>


<p>Imagine that you live in the dorms and in the hallway the rooms start at room 1 and at the end of the hall is room 20, the rooms go in order by number down the hall. so you can find out how many rooms are in the hall by taking the last room number - the first room number. The room numbers are just like the memory addresses</p>

<p>This approach only works with data structures that are continuous and will not work on data structures such as linked lists or trees where memory in the structures can be all over the memory</p></TEXT>

<p>I kept getting this error trying to use wget on the lab for this week. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the recent errors people have been getting about not being able to access the google drive. wget is pretty primitive and it will just download whatever it finds at that url, so if google tries to show you an error  message it will probably just download the error message without thinking twice. Your problem comes in when you try and extract the "archive" that isn't actually an archive, hence the error "not in gzip format"</p></TEXT>

<p>Your second one will not work. You can pass something that is const into something that doesn't expect whatever is being passed in to be const, but not the other way around.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The compiler will complain about the "b=c;" statement, because you are trying to assign a more restrictive type (const char*) to a less restrictive type (char*), which means that the content pointed to by c (meant to be unmodifiable) will now become modifiable via b (which is not a const char*).</p>

<p>The compiler will not complain about the "c=b;" statement, because it is ok to assign a less restrictive type (char*) to a more restrictive type (const char*).</p>

<p>However! As rightfully pointed out by a student in the 12pm section, even if the compiler does not complain about the "c=b;" statement, you can still get unwanted effects with "c=b;" at runtime. I.e., b remains an "open door" for the content pointed to by c, so after c=b, you can modify the content pointed by c via b.</p>

<p>Consider this code:</p>

<p>int main () {<br />  char *b;<br />  const char *c;<br />  c=b;                    //try also replacing this with b=c -- the compiler will complain<br />  b[0] = 'x';             //try also replacing this with c[0] = 'x' -- the compiler will complain <br /><br />  std::cout &lt;&lt; *c;  // this will print out "x" -- which is a modified version of the content pointed to by c<br />}</p></TEXT>

<p>Why is it named contained_by when it could be named cover_by? </p>

<p>Cover-by is more specific, requiring that the root (top-most element) is the same for A and B, and then moving downwards from there.</p>
<p>However, contained_by isn't as specific, it can't be any tree in B for tree A.</p>

<p>Thus, why is it named contained_by if the specs says that it returns true for if its cover_by??</p>

<p>I am trying to write the traversal function and I can't think of a way to do this completely. I have the idea in mind but getting it in code doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>What I am planning:<br />Traverse all the way left as far as possible and return that element into the list.</p>
<p>Go back one step in the tree and go right.</p>
<p>Go left from there as far as possible and return that element.</p>
<p>Return back one step, go right, etc...</p>
<p>However, once I get to the point where I need to return to the original part of the left subtree and go upwards once more, I have no idea how to return to that exact spot.</p>
<p>Hopefully that made sense, but if not here is a tree for example with 8 and 9 subtrees of 5, the rest obvious</p>

<p>          4    5  6   7</p>
<p>               8 9</p>
<p>The way I'm thinking is that I would go left to 4, return 4 and go up to 2. I would return 2 then and go right to 5. I would go all the way left from 5 and return 8. Return back to 5 , return 5, and go right to 9. Go left from 9 (which doesn't exist) -- since it doesn't exist I would return 9 and try to go right. Since that doesn't exist I would return back to 5. At this point, how would I get back to 2? I know I could return, but if the tree was longer down how would I do it?</p>
<p>This is just one scenario that could go wrong in my method. I have no idea how to go about this</p></TEXT>

Traversal Help</TEXT>

<p>You should stop thinking of trees as individual elements as a first step. Think of trees as a left subtree, an element, and a right subtree. So, in your traversal function, you want to make a list that consists of the left subtree, followed by the element, followed by the right subtree. If you have your base cases worked out properly, then this will return a list of the whole tree. You should draw out all the stack frames on a small example subtree to convince yourself.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're checking if the tree is empty one level too high. You should be checking if the tree passed into traversal is empty. I don't think you need a helper function for this tree function, either. But regardless, if a tree is empty, what should traversal return?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If a left subtree is empty, traversal should return the element, go backwards, return that element and then traverse the right subtree. If a right subtree is empty, traversal should return to the element previous of the previous element, right?</p>
<p>Also, if I switch my 1st line of code to after the first recursive call, wouldn't the compiler fail because it would try to use an empty tree?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You should not check if the left or the right subtree is empty. You should check that the tree is empty. If you call traversal on the left subtree of your tree, and that subtree is empty, the next stack frame will be traversal called with an empty tree. In this stack frame, you should return a list representation of an empty tree. This will return up one stack frame to the tree with empty subtrees. Now you know what the left subtree as a list is. You can do the same on the right side.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok. I changed my function.</p>
<p>if (tree_isEmpty(tree)) //Base Case</p>
<p>return list;</p>
<p>if (!tree_isEmpty(tree))</p>

<p>    traversalhelp(tree_left(tree), list);</p>
<p>    list = append(list, tree_elt(tree));</p>
<p>   traversalhelp(tree_right(tree), list);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>return list;</p>

<p>Now the only thing my function is doing is returning the top value of my top tree.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm close now, or is this something I should come into office hours for to get further help?</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What is list? It looks like you're trying to keep track of a running list of the tree tail recursively, which is not possible when using trees.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So if I completely rid of the variable list and don't keep a running list how do I make the list happen?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You make a variable within the function (so it only exists in the current stack frame). Each stack frame will return a list to the one above it. The one that gets lists returned to it will append all these lists together with the element into one bigger list, and then return that up to the next stack frame above it, etc. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thank you so much for all your help. It is much appreciated</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No problem :)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok this helps. So I have to recursively do that for each subtree -- make the left subtree, return that element, and then make the right subtree until the bottom of each. So basically what I should do is call the left subtree as the first part of the call. If theres no left subtree anymore, return that element and return back to the original part of that tree. How do I return back to that original element and then move on to the right subtree?</p>
<p>My code:</p>
<p>list_t traversalhelp(tree_t tree, list_t list)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>    if (!tree_isEmpty(tree_left(tree)))</p>
<p>    return traversalhelp(tree_left(tree), list);</p>
<p>    list = append(list, tree_elt(tree));</p>

<p>This means that somewhere in your code you're passing an empty list into a function that requires its list parameter is not empty. Both list_first and list_rest require that lists passed as parameters to them aren't empty; check your function to make sure you're not violating any requires clauses.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is there a way for us to tell which autograder test case tests which function? For instance, my partner &amp; I failed test cases 7a and 5a, but don't know which functions those test cases apply to.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
specific autograder test cases</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm almost certain that they won't make that information publicly available. The specs stress writing your own test cases, so hopefully you've been doing that. That being said, I doubt the available autograder test cases are overly complicated, so you should be able to see which functions are producing incorrect output in your own test cases.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>that's a bummer; it would be quite helpful.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Unfortunately, we won't expose such information. Testing is actually a part of the project.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have the contained_by(A, B) checking to make sure A is covered by all of B or any subtree of B.</p>

<p>I have the covered_by(A, B) checking to make sure A is covered by B.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble figuring out how to check if part of A is empty, and if so how to implement this in the function. If I have it return true when A is empty, it may incorrectly say B covers it when it does not.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
covered_by() function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have a problem somewhat similar to this.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So, a conceptual definition of covered by would be something like this: Imagine a tree B that has three levels. If you start chopping off elements from the bottom part of B, then any tree that results from these chops is covered by B. Also, you have to remember that any empty tree is covered by all other trees.</p>

<p>It's easier if you draw out an example of what would happen if you ran your code, drawing every single stack frame and what it returns. However, I will try to explain it with words. So if you have a tree B that is balanced, and you have a tree A that is just the leftmost part of B, then A is still covered by B. As you recurse down, you're going to check that the left subtree of A is covered by the left subtree of B, the right subtree of A is covered by the right subtree of B, and that the elts of A and B are equal. So, in this example, the right subtree of A is empty. So, when you call covered_by again on the right subtrees of A and B (in the recursive call), you're checking to see if an empty tree is covered by the right subtree of B, which is true.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Without seeing the compiler errors and also possibly the code, there is no way to tell why your code isn't compiling. If you're absolutely sure that your submits are being used up for the day, then email <a href="mailto:eecs280staff@umich.edu">eecs280staff@umich.edu</a> regarding this problem. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Another thing that might be helpful is to try to compile in the terminal using the command given in the spec before submitting to the autograder. That way, you won't waste any submits and you'll get error messages telling you why it isn't compiling. </p></TEXT>

<p>Nope. If you <em>have</em> a partner and you don't specify that you have a partner in group.txt, we will take points off. It would be silly for us to take points off because you don't have a partner to specify.</p></TEXT>

<p>Ignore what I said above about passing by reference. I tried it on a simple test program, and I got all sorts of compiler errors. I'm not exactly sure why, but I think it has something to do with non-const references to things. There <em>may</em> be a way to hack it together so that it compiles, but I'd suggest not trying it.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>I'm pretty sure OS X ships with the "tar" utility, so you should be able to run the command</p>
<pre>tar -czf submit.tar.gz p2.cpp p2-tests.cpp group.txt</pre>
<p>in the directory your project is in and submit that tar file. I just copied that tar command from the makefile so it should work correctly, but I would back your project up just in case because it's pretty easy to overwrite files from the command line.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm not really sure why you are inserting 0's into your list, I recommend looking at your base case and where ever else you are making list and try making and see where you would possibly be putting 0's an instead make empty lists.

<p>**I saw this happen to another student in office hours. Try testing your append list function with an empty list and a list with values in it. If the list is empty, are you returning zero? If so, that's your error right there. Hope that helps!</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I had a question about CHOP and the unsigned int n as an input.</p>

<p>Can someone explain the reasoning behind why int n is unsigned? What should happen in our code if a negative number is entered?</p>

<p>I understand that a negative will 'wrap around', but I'm not sure how our code should accommodate for that.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Chop and Unsigned int n</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
The purpose of having the argument be of type unsigned int is to ensure that n will only be positive. The chop function chops off the last n elements of a list. You can't chop off negative numbers of elements because a list can't have a negative number of elements.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It looks like for this project there's no defined behavior for our functions when the requirements clause is not met. Basically it looks like if the requirements aren't met you can do anything or nothing. I doubt it will be tested, especially since the functions aren't taking any user input directly.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>this ^</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How would we account for this in our test cases? If I understand correctly, inputting negative numbers would cause n to be positive but also larger than elements in the list, thus violating the Requires clause in the function.</p></TEXT>

<p>So I caught myself using functions from both recursive and recursive.list. For example, I used list_isEmpty(list) and list.is_empty(). They both do the same thing, but from a style standpoint, should I be using list_isEmpty(list) or list.is_empty()?</p></TEXT>

Autograder</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm just guessing but it's probably AutoGrader ERRor. More speculation: it could be some kind of runtime error in the autograder when it tries to call your functions. <span style="text-decoration:line-through">Do they have the right return types and argument types?</span> Actually now that I think about it again that would cause a compile error not a runtime error. Maybe you're failing an assert? Its fairly hard to say where the error could be, especially if it runs fine on your machine.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>I don't want to say it *couldn't* be because I don't know for sure what the error means, but that wouldn't be likely to cause an error. Even if it did, it would probably be an error at compile time. Since your code compiles, I'm assuiming AG_ERR means a runtime error when the autograder tried to test your code. I would double check that you're not trying to access a list or tree element that doesn't exist</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The autograder doesn't check my test file for errors does it? It only takes my p2.cpp and uses it for its own test cpp right?</p>
<p>Also if i were to access a list or tree that doesn't exist in my p2.cpp file, wouldn't Xcode throw an error?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Yeah, the autograder will have its own tests. What I suspect is happening is your tests aren't catching an edge case that causes some sort of error. Again, I don't actually know what that AG_ERR means, it could be something entirely different so I'd suggest going to office hours or asking an instructor</TEXT>

just reminding you that it's optional.

<p>Alternatively, it might be because you only have if statements with returns, and no else. If there's any way for an input to not get caught by one of the ifs (i.e. a negative number when you aren't expecting one and thus haven't accounted for it), the compiler will complain.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi</p>

<p>For my fib function, I am using</p>

<p>    if (n &gt;= 2){<br />        return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2));<br />    }<br />}</p>

<p>When I try to compile this in the linux terminal with </p>
<p>make p2-tests</p>
<p>I get</p>
<p>error: control reaches end of non-void function</p>

<p>By random tinkering I seem to have found a way to modify my code so that it works, but I still don't understand why anything was wrong in the first place. Shouldn't all possible cases be covered by those three if statements? How is it still slipping through without returning anything?</p></TEXT>

how to insert an element in a tree? (insert_tree)</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Tail Recursion Fibonacci</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That is not tail recursive because when you're returning "(fib_tailhelp(n-1, soFar) + fib_tailhelp(n-2, soFar))" which requires the program to know the values of fib_tailhelp(n-1, soFar) and fib_tailhelp(n-2, soFar) in order for the original fib_tailhelp function call to return. If your program just returned fib_tailhelp with no additional calculations (such as 3*fib_tailhelp, which is not tail recursive either) in the return call, then it would be tail recursive.</p>

<p>I would recommend thinking about how you would do the fib series iteratively then convert that to tail_recursive.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If I have a helper function I want to be tail recursive, and in the recursive call for it, I use list_make(elt, list) as one of the arguments in the call, does that mean that the function is no longer tail recursive since I'm calling another function after the recursive call?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Calling functions inside tail call?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Are you making any computations after the return statement? Are you calling a function that is not tail recursive after your return statement? If I understood correctly, you're still returning a call to your tail recursive function, so your function is tail recursive.</TEXT>

<p>For insert_tree and for traversal_tree, I'm looking to build my tree back up from the bottom. In another piazza question for insert_tree they said this was the best way. I'm confused on how I'm supposed to build it back up when there is no recollection of what else is in the tree? I am recursively changing what the value of tree is so when I try to build my tree back up there is no other tree that I can work back up. I hope this makes sense. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
building a tree from the bottom</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think you have to build the tree the way they explain how to make the example tree in another Piazza question. I tried making mine recursive, and it only returns the highest (or lowest) number in your iteration...I could be doing it wrong, but search "tree_make" on piazza and click on the post that talks about making the example tree</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Somehow you need to keep changing elt so you can make new subtrees with the sub elements.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Remember that a binary tree is an ordered tree, meaning you always know that if you use left_tree(tree), you will get all elements smaller than tree_elt(tree). And vice versa for the right side. This is all written in the project specs.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How would you keep the values at the top of the tree then?</p></TEXT>

<p>I believe there are some posts already on here that would help, but a couple general notes for insert that may help too:</p>

<p>Don't try to make your tree functions tail recursive, since it's more difficult here and an awkward way to handle trees. Don't try to accumulate / build up your tree as you go down, but instead have the returns pass up increasingly large parts of your tree to be put together into the final tree.</p>

<p>One thing I've been telling students in office hours is to consider how you could use tree_make to copy a tree, and then figure out how you would alter it so that instead of an exact copy, you're building up the version that has the element inserted in the correct place, but is the same everywhere else.</p></TEXT>

<p>For my traversal function, in each recursive step I create a new left and right subtree, then call the traversal function for the left subtree, add the element of the tree to my list, and then call the traversal function for the right subtree.

Traversal Help</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hint for base base: In the RME given for traversal(), it says that when an empty tree is passed through then it will return an empty list.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're most likely not creating the list properly and thus causing the function to create a new list when it begins the traversal down the right subtree. Try using cout instead of adding to list to see if you're actually traversing through all elements in the right order. If you are, then think of a way to build the list properly.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Wow, thanks. It couted (2 3 4 5) so I know my function is working, I guess my list is just being rewritten each time. I'll work on it, thanks for the tip!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Okay, so instead of returning zero I just made it return the cumulative list instead (so if the tree is empty to begin with it will return an empty list, and if any other passed subtree is empty it will return the list as is). I still get the same error.</p></TEXT>

<p>I just finished up the lab however, I'm still a bit fuzzy on one thing; the typedef. What was the purpose of using that and how exactly did it clean things up? Basically what I want to know is what the advantage was from using it?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Using typedef</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So sometimes the type of a variable is really easy, like int, double, unsigned int, and so on. But other times it can get really confusing, like with function pointers in the lab there was int (* fnptr) (int, int), where it's not immediately apparent what that means.</p>

<p>Instead of having to use the somewhat ugly and hard to read syntax for the function pointer that we're going to use to combine two ints and return an int, we can define a new type with typedef and only have to write out the whole type once. Since we've used typedef int (*intCombiner) (int, int) we can now declare a new function pointer that returns an int and takes two integers as arguments as intCombiner, where it's both clean to read and clear what the function is going to do.</p></TEXT>

If so, I have a few questions:
1)Neither my computer nor the computers in the fishbowl can open the "Makefile" file. What kind of file is it? Does it need to be opened in Linux?
2)Should I replace the files already in the .tar.gz folder with the edited p2tests.cpp and p2.cpp?
Thanks!</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Is there a way to submit via Windows instead of Linux?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can submit via Windows. However, it is your responsibility to make sure that your code can compile and run correctly in CAEN Linux environment, and that the .tar.gz file can be unpacked using "tar -xzvf submit.tar.gz" in CAEN (if not, the autograder will have problem unpack your file).</p>

<p>The makefile contains the command to compile and pack your code. You can type "make p2-tests" to compile and "make tar" to generate the .tar.gz file. You should submit the .tar.gz file that contains your p2.cpp, p2-tests.cpp and group.txt.</p>

<p>See @353 for detailed information on how to generate the .tar.gz file.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Follow-up: I've pretty much never used Linux before, so describing this in layman's terms would be helpful.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you use a different compiler in Xcode, I can say for sure that it will compile exactly the same way. Therefore I strongly recommend you using CAEN.</p>
<p>Use the make commands in command line.</p>
<p>You should follow @353 for the .tar.gz that you are to submit.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Is there any reason it wouldn't run in a CAEN environment if I used Xcode?
Where would I type "make p2-tests" and "make-tar?" I don't assume in the text editor?
Finally, the .tar.gz doesn't need any of the binary.cpp, recursive.cpp, etc. files, right?
Thanks!</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm just going through my code before i finally submit it and I realized that I never followed the protip #2 about not putting all the test cases in int main.

<p>Before submitting the final version I commented the project. However, I did not add comments to p2.cpp (but I added comments to p2-tests.cpp). Because p2.cpp functions are already commented in p2.h file, I did not think we would be required to write comments. Is this acceptable?</p></TEXT>

<p>So, fellow anons, who, like myself, failed to achieve and had my project fail on me in a desperate last minute struggle, what have we learned from this?<br />For the only option when met with failure is to think upon one's actions, and learn how to improve upon it.</p>

<p>1) Start earlier. Not 5 days before due date, and, even with that, allowing distractions and time off.</p>
<p>2) More tests. Extensive really means extensive. I must break the code.</p>
<p>3) Seek help. Throwing my brain against my monitor does little the fix the code that worked on paper, but not on the compiler.</p>

<p>You should read the specification all the way through first.

Shuffle and cut is on page 2, along with dealing the cards.  They also tell you what cpp files you should write starting on page 8.  I'm not sure how flexible the order is for writing the cpp files, but I'm going with the order on page 8.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Difference between pass by reference and pointers?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I was trying to answer originally, then realized it would be too long and hard to explain without graphics. &amp; and * operators are dramatically different. One of them simply returns a memory address, the other one points to the variable in  an address (and pointed variable [pointee] can be changed). I have to say that our textbook is poorly designed and graphical representations are almost non-existent, find Stephen Kochan's "Programming in C" 3rd edition and read the pointers chapter. This is also a good resource: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
A reference is actually just a constantly dereferenced pointer. So references and pointers both hold memory addresses, but you don't have to use the * operator because the reference is automatically dereferenced. However, because of that fact, you cannot reassign a reference to refer to a different variable/memory address. So, it is better to use pointers over references when you want to change where the pointer points to, like when you have traversal by pointer.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>A reference and a pointer can both hold the memory address of an object. Technically neither are objects (an "object" typically refers to an instance of a class). However, you can change which object a pointer points to, but you cannot change which object a reference refers to.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Maybe he meant to say that a pointer uses memory (I believe it was 4 bits?), while a reference does not?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>They actually both take up the same size (typically 8 bytes) because they both hold a memory address. They are laid out in memory similarly, but they are used in a program differently.

<p>I'm an avid euchre player, and know all of the rules. As I was reading through I noticed that you added an addition rule : "In addition to being ordered by rank, cards are also ordered by suit: diamonds first, then clubs, hearts, and spades." In what situation does this even take place? I'm assuming that trump is still the number one suit no matter what. Is this just incase different off-trump cards are played? For example, If a spades is lead and  the first 3 people play spades but the 4th player doesn't have a spade, and coincidentally plays a heart (assuming neither are trump), the player who plays the heart wins even though they technically wouldn't in the real euchre game?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Additional Rule</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe the ordered by rank is so that if the autograder checks an ace of diamonds against an ace of clubs with hearts as trump and spades led, the ace of diamonds will get returned (otherwise there is ambiguity about which card will get returned).  It should not have to do with playing the game (neither of the cards should win in the simulator).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Regardless of the game of Euchre itself, providing an ordering like this also ensures that no different cards compare as "equal", which is a nice property.</p>

<p>In response to one specific part of your question, the rules of Euchre (i.e. the variant defined by the project spec) are used to determine which card wins the hand.  The led and trump suits should still be considered, so the heart would not win.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>that should fail the assertion because clubs (card B) is higher than spades (card A) and therefore Card_compare should return a negative value</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Okay, thanks! I thought the ranking was based on the order they are listed in Card.cpp, but I just read the rules closer</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>they are but the trump screws things up a little</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Wait, then I am confused why that assertion should fail... I didn't think the trump should affect Card_compare in this case.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>opps I meant in general not for this specific case</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have also played Euchre many times before and am confused by this rule. TO be clear, the following test case should pass (assuming all .cpp files are written correctly)?:</p>

<p>assert(Card_compare(&amp;jack_spades, &amp;jack_clubs, &amp;jack_diamonds, HEARTS) &gt; 0);</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For adding/discarding, it says that the player will discard the lowest card.  I assume that if the player has 9, J, A in trump, and 10, Q out of trump, the player will discard the 10 (not trump) and not the 9 (trump).  Am I correct in assuming this?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Add and discard</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe that is correct. (As a player that's what I would do!)</p>

<p>This is because trump is the most important kind of card. I believe this is call "short-suiting" yourself. Having the fewest number of suits in your hand is good, especially if you have trump!</p>

<p>Also, remember that the jacks in the color of trump are also high cards. So if spades is trump and you had a jack of clubs, you would keep the jack of clubs!</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>So with the exception of the trump suit and the left bower, all other cards follow the published suit order? Is any special consideration given to cards of the suit of the same color as trump (aside from the left bower)?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Suit Order</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes follow the suit order otherwise. And only the left bower gets special consideration.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes. Trump is always the highest. Then the lead suit. Then the other suits.</p>

<p>So if diamonds is trump and someone leads clubs and you have neither diamonds or clubs you want to play a card of the other two suits.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks :D</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But just to clarify: in the case that the lead card's suit is different than the trump suit, then the suit order is trump &gt; lead suit &gt; two remaining suits in published order.</p>

<p>Unless I'm missing something...?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>There are some skeleton functions inside of Card.cpp that simple have</p>
<pre>//IMPLEMENT ME!<br />  assert(0);</pre>
<p>What is the assert(0) for? Can we remove it when we actually start to define the functions or is it meant to be there? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Card.cpp dummy functions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It looks like its just a way to remember which functions have been implemented and which haven't. You should remove the assert(0) when you implement the function.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You won't want your code to ever reach an assert(0) in the code (since it'd always evaluate to false and exit the program), so you could remove it from the final version. They're there to start with so that running your program will make it very clear if you've forgotten to write a function. If you like, you can leave it in while developing/testing your code. A StackOverflow answer to another question about assert(0) usage suggests that they can be handy when writing if, else if, ... decision structures, since it would tell you if you don't get into any of the ifs and instead hit the end of the function, indicating you need another case to cover all the possibilities.</p></TEXT>

<p>Also why are there 2 different Card_compare functions? Only difference between them is that one requires const variables.</p>

<p>See @656 about Card_compare_suit. </p>

<p>Also, those functions are overloaded depending on what parameters they take. The first Card_init function's second two parameters are of type Rank and Suit, respectively, while the second Card_init function's second two parameters are of type const char*. So the first one you could call as Card_init(&amp;card_name, QUEEN, HEARTS) for example, while the second you would call as Card_init(&amp;card_name, "Queen", "Hearts").</p>

<p>As for the Card_compare functions, the differences lie in the parameters. The first compare function doesn't take into account the trump suit. The second takes the trump suit into consideration when comparing card value. The third uses both the trump suit and the lead suit to determine the ordering of the cards.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!!</p></TEXT>

<p>Type char* is a pointer to char, which is one way to declare a C-style string - different than a regular char. Check out the lecture notes from last week for more on C-strings, etc.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks that helped, but now I'm a little confused as to how you're able to put a string for a parameter of type char? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Look at how the function Card_get_suit retrieves a card's suit. You can do something similar for the rank of the card.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How do you retrieve a cards rank? There is a Card_get_suit, but no such function for the rank of the card..? </p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If your empty string's length is less than that of the const char* string you're trying to copy, then you're going "out of bounds". Try creating a character array long enough to copy the source array.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Are we allowed to use the functions that come with cstring? Like strcmp? Also I've been trying to figure out a way to go from a cstring to a suit. Not sure how to go about that. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Pretty sure you're going to need strcmp - at least I did, and it's used in one of the given tests in Player_tests. And the spec emphasizes that you should #include &lt;cstring&gt;, so you should be fine.</p>

<p>Note that there's an array of strings called SUIT_NAMES defined in Card.cpp that might be helpful.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How do I use strcpy()?</p>

<p>When I try to use it I get an access violation exception... I define a pointer to a char and set it equal to an empty string, then I use strcpy(emptyStr, variable of type const* char). </p>

<p>Its not modifying that const* char variable so I'm not sure what the problem is.. </p></TEXT>

group.txt</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think that since the second line is the command creating the tar version, it will have still made it with group.txt. Leaving it out of the first line means that it doesn't recognize it depends on group.txt, and doesn't check for changes in it if you make tar again without changing the other files.</p>

<p>You should be able to open the submit.tar.gz that you made in order to see if it includes all three files. Also, if the autograder continued and gave you other feedback, this should mean that it received all of the files it was expecting.</p></TEXT>

<p>You have to convert the const char * to an enum in order to assign it to an enum. Check a2e function from lecture.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so I wrote a string2enum function (basically the same one showed in lecture). but when I try to call it in Card_init, I get the error message "No matching function for call to "string2enum." I feel like it might be from the way I'm passing arguments to the function...just want to make sure: is it okay to pass the Card_init's rank and suit arguments to string2enum? so it'd be something like: string2enum&lt;Rank&gt;(rank, ...., ......) ?</p></TEXT>

Initializing Player's Hand</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Glad you sorted it out; if you're still uncertain, feel free to post a new question.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm a little confused what you're asking but you shouldn't need to worry about cards that don't exist in your hand because they don't exist for any purpose you need, so changing the hand size to 0 should be good enough</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm also a little confused on this as well. I'm not sure what to change other than initializing the hand size to 0. I know that Cards each have a rank and type and if none of the cards in a hand "exist" then i'm not sure how to initialize that accordingly.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the specs it says that cards are ordered by Suit first then rank. So for example if we are comparing 2 cards and they are of the same suit, then we should compare them by rank. </p>

<p>But in the specs for Card_compare it says that we should return 0 if the cards are equal..? I can't think of a situation where any 2 cards would be equal.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Will any cards ever be equal?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For this project, you're right: two different cards cannot be equal.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For this project, you're right: two cards cannot be equal.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Real reason: It's in the effects clause of those functions.</p>

<p>Side reason: When you are testing to see if a certain card was led, played, or somewhere else you are probably going to need to compare the card to an expected value.  ie: you want to test if the player led with a jack of spades.  The function for that will return a card, so you should compare that card to a card of the expected value (an extra card initialized to the jack of spades).  Of course, you could just check the card's suit and rank.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Even though it's not possible for 2 cards to be equal in an actual game, should we still include code that checks for equality and return 0 if two cards are equal? And the only time that code executes is during testing, (for example, if we purposely pass 2 Jack of Spades) and not during an actual game?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the spec, it says "If a player can follow suit, he plays the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, he plays the lowest card in his hand."</p>

<p>Just to make sure I'm not missing something, the player would NOT play a trump card if he cannot follow suit?</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Pack_deal_one</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
remember that arrays are contiguous chunks of memory and therefore you can traverse them using a pointer. so if you have a pointer to the start of an array you can go through the whole thing and you just need to dereference the pointer to access the element in the array</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you can't index with a pointer directly. you deference the pointed at the start to get the first element using the * operator. Then you can increment the pointer itself to make it point to the next chunk of memory.</p>
<p>here's an example of going through an array with a pointer. There should also be more examples in the slides for this week.</p>

<pre>int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};<br />const int length = 4;<br />int* ptr = array //array is actually a pointer to the beginning of the array<br />for(int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++, ptr++)//keeping a count of how many times it loops and also incrementing the pointer after every loop<br />{<br />	//simply printing out each element of the array<br />	cout &lt;&lt; *ptr &lt;&lt; " ";<br />}<br /><br /></pre>
<p>for the project you are most likely going to just need to loop through the entire array every time to look for things.</p>

 <TEXT>
Card_compare</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's there to make sure that rank is more important than suit. It ensures that the only time the suit of the cards becomes significant is when the ranks of the cards are equal. </p>

<p>For example, ignoring trump and the led suit, if card A has a higher rank than card B, then it will always have a higher value because of the formula. Suit will only matter when the ranks are the same.</p></TEXT>

<p>card_ptr -&gt; rank</p>

<p>So if card_ptr pointed to card, then that would return card.rank</p></TEXT>

it's the same thing as (*card_ptr).rank it accesses the member variables of what the pointer points to but with less typing</TEXT>

<p>Yes you will use -&gt; in your code. See @683 for more about it. But for your question - getting the suit of a card - it actually depends on the context.</p>

<p>card_ptr-&gt;suit and Card_get_suit() do two different things. card_ptr-&gt;suit gets the Suit of the Card to which card_ptr points, not taking into account trump. Card_get_suit() gets the Suit of the card in question <em>considering</em> <em>trump</em>. So say the trump suit is Hearts, and you have the Jack of Diamonds - the left bower. card_ptr-&gt;suit would give you Diamonds as the Card's suit, but Card_get_suit() would give you Hearts because the left bower is considered to be of the trump suit.</p>

<p>Hope that makes sense!</p></TEXT>

<p>Consider that a C string is defined as a char array (which is a pointer). Unless you want to actually compare the pointers (equality meaning the strings being located at the same memory address) then you should use strcmp to compare the actual characters located at those addresses.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>never mind I figured it out!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I am trying to call strcmp in a string2enum function and I get an error message unless I put an &amp; in front of my second argument passed to strcmp (so it wants &amp;[name variable] ). Why is this happening? I put pretty much exactly what the string2enum function was from the lecture slides, so I don't see what could be causing the problem...</p></TEXT>

<p>I tried to test it but since it is not in the header file, Card-tests did not recognize it as defined in its scope. However, defining it in Card-tests leads to a compiler error of being defined in two spaced.

<p>In the Card_init function, we're supposed to initialize the place that card_ptr points to to a specific rank and suit. But I don't understand how the pointer can point to a rank and a suit. How can it point to more than one thing at a time?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Card_init Function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Card_ptr is a pointer to a card structure, within this structure are fields for both suit and rank.</p>

<p>Hopefully, that is enough to figure out your problem.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So you know how to use the dot to get to something of a struct?</p>
<p>This is like if card wasn't a pointer, so just do card.rank.</p>

<p>But we don't have card, we only have a pointer to card. So we can do (*card).rank or use card-&gt;rank is less typing.</p>

<pre>Card_init(&amp;two_spades, "Two", "Spades")</pre>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Card_Init with char</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The way you gave for initializing Two of Spades with the strings as parameters is correct, if that's what you're asking. The potential input options are enumerated in the Requires clause for the Card_init function. Then, to test that you've actually initialized the card properly, you can do something like what's in Card_tests and assert two_spades.rank == TWO, etc.</p>

<p>I'm not exactly sure what you're asking, but I hope that helps.</p></TEXT>

<p>The three files stated. They need to pass the published test cases. Yes that means you can simply make your code "return this, return that, ..." etc. and still get full credit for the checkpoint, but then you'd be leaving yourself with more work to do when the due date is approaching. Yes, only what you turn in for the final submission is going to be graded with very rigorous unpublished test cases and you can edit those files more as you find other bugs, but it can only be beneficial for you to debug before the checkpoint and not leave that until the last minute to do.</p></TEXT>

<p>This was a little confusing for me too, but I think Cathy helped me very well with it!</p>

<p>You have to sometimes consider the led card, because the suit of the led card comes next in the ordering after trump.</p>

<p>So just considering trump the order is right bower, left bower, rest of trump, …. other suits and their ranks, etc.</p>

<p>BUT if you play a hand and no one plays trump, then the most valuable cards are those matching the suit that was led. So the new order is trump, suit of led, other suits and their ranks, etc.</p>

<p>So if spades is trump, but diamonds is led and you as a player don't have trump but have diamonds (and must play a diamond), your diamond is higher than another suit, (regardless of rank).</p></TEXT>

how to call Card_compare(const Card *a, const Card *b, Suit trump)</TEXT>

<p>The last parameter is of type Suit, which is an enumerated type defined in Card.h. Take a look at the possible values of type Suit in that file: SPADES, HEARTS, CLUBS, DIAMONDS. So in your example, you could have Spades be the trump parameter for the function by literally typing in SPADES. </p>

<p>As a side note, it ultimately depends on the context in which you call the function. If you're determining the trump suit in gameplay based on a specific Card, you could have the parameter be card_name.suit; or if you have a pointer to Card then you'd do card_pointer-&gt;suit. All of the above are of type Suit.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm not sure if it's required, but it's a good safeguard; assert(0) will always fail, so if you want to make sure your program will never reach a certain point (and crash if it does) then you can leave it in there. For example, in the function Suit_next() the default case is to assert(0) in case the suit passed as parameter in the function isn't one of SPADES, HEARTS, CLUBS, or DIAMONDS. So the point is that control shouldn't reach the default, but if it does at least you'll have an idea of where things went wrong.</p></TEXT>

<p>The led card has Spades as the suit, and the trump is Clubs. Would Player 1 then play the Jack of Spades, instead of the Ace of Spades? In other words, does the trump suit's order extend into the led suit?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Question on a specific case when playing a card</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From Project spec:</p>
<p>"The left bower is also considered a trump card. For example, if Diamonds</p>
<p>is trump, the Jack of Hearts is also considered a Diamond, not a Heart."</p>

<p>The player, therefore, cannot play the Jack of Spades, as it would be playing out of suit.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As per the spec:</p>
<p>"If a player can follow suit, he plays the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, he plays the lowest card in his hand."</p>

<p>To answer your question, yes, he would still play the Ace of Spades.</p>

<p>The spec has a lot of answers in it, try digging around a little bit more before posting questions.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I noticed while browsing CTools that there was an announcement on September 29 (two days ago) that reads:</p>

<pre>There has been a minor change to Card.cpp.starter. Please download a fresh copy of the file.</pre>

<p>Is this update critical? I don't know if I have the old version or the new version, but I already finished writing all of the code in Card.cpp and formatting its style to be consistent with my own style. I'd rather not re-download if the change isn't important. </p></TEXT>

<p>In this function, do we have to design it so that unrealistic events may take place? Like even though impossible in the actual game, should my code consider for example that both a and b are right bowers so in this case 0 should be returned?</p>

<p>Hope that makes sense.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
int Card_compare(const Card *a, const Card *b, Suit trump) {</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, 0 should be returned in the case that a and b point to Cards of equal value. Straight from the function RME: "Returns zero if cards are equal." Also, as a side note, the Card_compare functions are really useful in testing - so though it may not be realistic that a and b will point to the same Card in gameplay, it might come in handy to check if a and b point to same Card in testing.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm testing my card_compare and it's messing up somewhere where I think it should not.</p>

<p>Let's say clubs are trump. I'm comparing the ace of spades and the king of diamonds. Niether card is trump, so the ranking should go off of suit, and that means the king of diamonds should be ranked higher, shouldn't it?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Card compare test</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Actually, the ace of spades should be ranked higher. From the spec: "The complete ordering of all the cards is: J (right bower, high), J (left bower), A, K, Q, 10, 9 of the trump suit. <strong>The aces of the remaining three suits follow in suit order</strong>, the remaining kings in suit order..."</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Oh okay, thank you. I now see what I missed.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>if neither card is trump (or left bower)  and you don't need to worry about led card then we gave you a card compare function that just compares two cards</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
If neither card is trump, does that mean it goes solely off of the rank?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm a bit confused about what is meant by "up-card" vs what is meant by "order-up_suit" that's passed in this function. My understanding is that the player looks at the suit of the up card and returns true or false depending on the cards in their hand and the current round.</p>

<p>Does that mean that the suit of the up card is also passed separately as "order_up_suit"? If that's the case, I don't understand why we need to be changing order_up_suit depending on whether it's true or false.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Player_make_trump question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Come to office hours for specific code issues.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Another issue I am having with this function is that I'm currently traversing the array using pointer arithmetic but i don't understand why it doesn't seem to work using array indexing.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>During the second round of making, if the first three Players pass then the dealer is forced to order-up the up-card.  Thus we must know which Player is the dealer.  The only way we know which Player is the dealer in this function is by passing in a pointer to the dealer.  We can then compare the current Player to the current dealer (via pointers) to check if this Player is in fact the dealer.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I also don't understand why the dealer's hand is passed in this function?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The up-card is the card flipped up on top of the deck.  If a player chooses to "order up", the trump suit will be changed to the suit of the up-card.<br /><br />You are correct in your initial understanding. Notice that we pass the up-card as const pointer, meaning that we cannot change its value, whereas we pass the order-up suit as just a pointer, meaning that we can change it. The order-up suit will not necessarily be equal to the suit of the up-card -- rather, we pass in the order-up suit so we can change it if the Player chooses to order-up the up-card.<br /><br />Put another way: the up-card lets us know what card and suit to consider, the order_up_suit is passed in not necessarily equal to the up-card so we can change it if the Player wants to order-up.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yep see the specs for more details</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry to bother again, but just to make sure i'm understanding correctly: the purpose of player_make_trump is to check the necessary things (given round 1 or 2) from the perspective of the player pointer passed in. If player happens to be dealer, then the behavior is different. Is that correct?</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm confused as to the suit order for Card_compare(const Card *a, const Card *b, const Card *led_card, Suit trump). Is it trump suit, then led card suit, then remaining suits in given order OR is it led card suit, trump suit, remaining suits in given order? </p>

<p>i.e. If I passed in a ten of hearts and jack of spades and the led card was a queen of hearts and trump was spades, which should win? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Card_compare with led card</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think it's whether or not the first or second card is better than one another relative to the card led and the suit that is currently trump. In your example, since the suit is spades, card B would be better than both the led_card and card a, so it should return negative.</p></TEXT>

I really don't see what could be breaking the code with just the init functions in Pack and Player. Did anyone else run into this problem?</p>

<p>You are correct about initializing hand size to 0.  As long as you respect this invariant, i.e. never try to access player.hand[3] if hand_size == 1, then you should be fine and needn't worry about "junk values" in the other cards.</p></TEXT>

<p>In the spec, it says "During round one, a player will order up if he has two or more trump face cards in his hand." I was wondering, if the dealer is making the decision whether to pick up the face up card or not, does he consider it as a card in his hand?<br /><br />For example, if the dealer has one trump face card in his hand and the up card is also a trump face card, will he order up trump?</p></TEXT>

<p>Yes, passing all the labs during the semester is necessary to earn the 5% of the points. The labs are all equal percentage.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the spec it says</p>

<pre>In addition to being ordered by rank, cards are also ordered by suit: diamonds first, then clubs, hearts, and spades.</pre>

<p>Under The heading "The Play" in the spec it states</p>

<pre>A trick is won by the highest trump, or, if it contains no trump by the highest card of the suit led.</pre>

<p>so if each turn has a lead card that determines the win, I'm a bit confused why card order matter?</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Why does Card Order matter?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>card order matters so that your card_compare functions will always return a negative or a positive number when you compare two cards that are not the exact same card. It allows us to have one distinct outcome for each set of inputs we give your program.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It seems like the most apparent application of this order is when trying to find the lowest card in one's hand.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>At the bottom of the given test cases, it says:</p>

<p>////////////////////////////////////////<br /> // Card_init() unit tests<br /> // these tests will pass once you code<br /> // void Card_init(Card *card_ptr, Rank rank, Suit suit);<br /> Card_init(&amp;two_spades, "Two", "Spades");<br /> assert(two_spades.rank == TWO &amp;&amp; two_spades.suit == SPADES);</p>

<p>The lines that confuse me are:</p>
<p>// these tests will pass once you code<br />// void Card_init(Card *card_ptr, Rank rank, Suit suit);</p>

<p>But isn't void Card_init(Card *card_ptr, Rank rank, Suit suit) a function they coded for us already? Shouldn't it say void Card_init(Card *card_ptr, const char* rank, const char* suit), which is the function they then list right below the comments? Thanks.<br /></p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Question about comment in Card_tests.cpp</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, you're right. Card_init with the last two parameters of Rank and Suit types has already been implemented for us. The Card_init you need to implement is the one with the two const char* parameters, and if implemented correctly you should be able to initialize a card by passing in strings for Rank and Suit.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Can I use a function I wrote in Card.cpp in Pack.cpp? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Use of Our Functions from other cpp files</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, you'll need to.</p>
<p>If it's declared in the project spec, you probably can and should. If it's a helper function not defined in the header files or project spec, it should be restricted to file scope, so probably not.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, you'll need to.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm not sure why you would need to use a helper function without one of the functions that was declared in Card.h you do realize that Pack.h #includes "Card.h" which means you can use any function declared there in any pack functions. Those should be all you need.</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am confused on how we are supposed to determine card value. I know how to play euchre, so obviously trump suit will have higher value than other suits, but say for example spades is trump, then would the queen of hearts and the queen of diamonds have the same value? Or do non trump suits have a specific order for this project?</p></TEXT>

Card values</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From page one of the spec,</p>

<p>"To simplify debugging and ensure that every correct solution will get the same output, we’ve added an additional rule here. In addition to being ordered by rank, cards are also ordered by suit: diamonds first, then clubs, hearts, and spades."</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>nope look at the second page of the specs again under "THE PLAY" the person that plays the highest trump or the highest card of the same suit as the led card wins the trick</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Just to clarify, if the queen of hearts is lead and the next player plays the queen of diamonds (neither being trump), the queen of diamonds will win that trick?</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm having trouble understanding the purpose of "Screw the dealer" where the dealer has to assign the order_up_suit in the same color suit of the suit of the upcard. Wouldn't the alternative be that a player other than the dealer does the same thing provided they have at least one face card in the opposite color of the suit of the upcard?</p>
<p><br />Isn't the outcome the same in both cases?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Make trump question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If after round 2 and you get to the dealer, the dealer has to call trump. And for the purposes of this project, trump will be the suit of the card turned up if round 1, otherwise the other suit of the same color if round 2.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Never mind. I understand now!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>can you explain this? i still don't get it</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Right. My question is that if it's round 2, either 2 things can happen (from my understanding):</p>
<p>1. A player calls a suit in the opposite color of the upcard if they have at least 1 face card in that particular suit.</p>
<p>2. Dealer calls the opposite suit of the upcard.</p>

<p>Both cases result in the suit being declared as the opposite of the upcard's suit. My confusion is that I don't understand the point of having separate function paths for this if they ultimately result in the same thing (when round = 2)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Dealer can pass on round 1, and is forced to order up on round 2.  If the dealer couldn't pass on round 1, then there simply wouldn't be a round 2.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Dealer can still pass if it's round 1 correct? They're only forced to order-up if it's round 2, right?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think I'm confusing myself a bit. If I have a pointer "bar" and right now it points to variable "foo". If I wanted to change the variable that it pointed to, would i just say, bar = newVariable?</p></TEXT>

Pointers</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>it depends on what that new variable is. If the new variable is also a pointer of that points to the same type then you're all good, If the new variable actually holds a value then you need to assign the pointer to the memory address of the new variable by using the &amp; operator to get the memory address of the new variable.</p>

Card card2 = pack_ptr-&gt; *next;

*Next pointer</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The -&gt; operator both unpacks the pointer and references the element of the Struct. Also if you're trying to assign something to next, next goes on the left.  next points to a card.  You can't set next equal to a card.  Only a card pointer.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So to be clear, Pack_reset only resets the *next pointer to the first card in the pack in its current order.  Yes?</p>
<p>So if I call Pack_reset on an unshuffled pack.in the next pointer will be set to the nine of spades while calling it on a shuffled version of pack.in would assign *next to the first card in the shuffled deck (Queen of Spades if I'm not mistaken)?  Is that correct?</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Pack_reset</TEXT>

<p>Yes. Pack_reset should reset the next pointer to point to whatever Card is first in the Pack. So if you've shuffled the default Pack and then reset the next pointer, then yes next should be pointing to the Queen of Spades.</p></TEXT>

Question about pointers</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
unless you made a typo those are the same thing</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yep, they're the same thing. Just note that if I had something like</p>
<pre>char* rank, suit;</pre>
<p>then rank would be a pointer to char, whereas suit would be a regular char. In that case it would be the same as declaring</p>
<pre>char *rank;<br />char suit;</pre>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Perhaps I'm misunderstanding Pack_init, but I've made it so that cards[] is an array that holds each card in it, with each card having a .rank and a .suit.</p>

<p>When using the original code of:<br /><br /></p>
<pre>	Card first_card = *(pack.next);<br />	assert(Card_compare(&amp;first_card, &amp;nine_spades) == 0);</pre>

<p>It gives me a Segmentation Fault (core dumped).</p>

<p>However, when comparing card &amp;nine_spades to &amp;pack.cards[0] (in other words the first card...) and asserting that they're equal, it passes fine.</p>

<p>Thus, I'm not really understanding what's going on here. Somehow, *next isn't working for me and it might be because I misunderstanding the function? Can someone explain to me how *next is supposed to work behind the scenes or why I'm getting a Segmentation Fault when using *next?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Error with *(pack.next)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Before you dereference the next pointer to get the Card to which it points, are you making sure the next pointer actually points to something? In other words, after you initialize your pack, next needs to point to the very first card in the pack.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Got it! I never actually initialized *next and once I pointed it to the very first card in the pack, everything worked.</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p></TEXT>

<p>I seem to have a problem getting the pack test case and the player test case to pass the autograder even though all pass the test cases I made.  After I submitted to the autograder (and failed), I searched through Piazza to find anything I might have done wrong.  I fixed a couple things and uploaded again.</p>

<p>I still failed.  Then I thought to just start programming the game portion (which I stayed up last night doing).  When I find something that goes wonky, I know it's that function that is the problem.  There was a huge flaw in this approach.  I successfully coded the game simulator without changing any of the Player or Pack code (diff returned nothing for 00.correct and 01.correct).  (instead of programming, I could have stood in line for smash bros midnight release, but I regret nothing.  Especially considering I don't have a 3ds)</p>

<p>So my question is are there functions you found hard to implement, or had some special test case that took time to figure out how to make it pass?  Perhaps that could give me a start as to where I should start looking.  I'm just not sure exactly what more to test.</p></TEXT>

<p>I have no idea where your specific issues are of course, but here are some of the "little" things I noticed while coding Pack.cpp and Player.cpp that might make a difference to you:</p>

<p>-In Pack, are you resetting or incrementing the next pointer as appropriate?</p>
<p>-Did you try manually making a shuffled pack.in? That way you can compare the output of your shuffling algorithm to the expected output.</p>
<p>-In Player.cpp, you'll need to consider how you're getting the suit of a card. Say you're considering the Jack of Hearts; it's a Heart, but depending on whether or not the trump suit has been declared, it may no longer be a Heart.</p>
<p>-Many of the Player.cpp functions deal with finding a "lowest" or "highest" card in the Player's hand depending on varying criteria. You could find the highest trump; or the highest non-trump; or the highest card of the lead suit; or so on. You have to be specific about which cards you're going to consider/disregard.</p>
<p>-Finally, are you making sure to update the hand size of a player when he/she plays a card?</p>

<p>I hope this gives you some ideas.</p></TEXT>

<p>Pointers are still a little bit iffy in my mind.</p>
<p>I see that card_ptr is pointing to "Card" but how do I know what the struct of "Card" has in it? Is that based on the order of cards by suit and then the order of cards by number? And if so, would I just want to make card_ptr point to the element in the struct Card with the card "number"? For example, is the jack of diamonds == Card[1] so that if if I knew I was initializing the card to Jack of Diamonds i would type "card_ptr --&gt; Card[1]" or am I completely wrong?</p>

This should answer your second question too. If the up card was a Heart and it's round 2, Hearts can no longer be trump. Since the player has one or more face cards of the related color suit, Diamonds, he will order up Diamonds. From the spec: "During round two..for example, if the up card was a heart and he had the king of diamonds in his hand, he would order up diamonds."</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Never mind! For all those who might encounter the same problem -- the last card in the deck should point back to the first card!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That doesn't really make any sense.  If you're working with a real deck once you've dealt all the cards the next card to deal isn't the first card you dealt.  Also, in euchre, there should be 4 cards left (one is the upcard) after you deal a hand 2-3-2-3  3-2-3-2 to all the players.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Furthermore, based on the requires clause of deal_one (the function that actually works with reassigning the *next pointer) you only should be calling deal_one if there are cards left in the pack.  Once you've dealt the 24th card, calling the partial function is a breaking of the rules of that function (one could use an assert to ensure that calling a deck with 0 cards isn't inadvertently done during testing).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What should pack.next be for the last card in the deck? Should it point back to the first card or be set to nothing? My deck is initializing properly (I printed it out and it matches the txt file) but I'm still failing the assert</p></TEXT>

<p>What is meant by an empty hand for player_init? Would it be just an array of size 5 with unassigned elements? Or would having a hand with cards ranging from 2 to 8 also count as an empty hand since Euchre only uses cards 9 to ace?</p></TEXT>

player_init empty hand</TEXT>

<p>Empty hand means the player has no cards in their hand. How many cards does that equate to? What variable does that associate with?</p></TEXT>

<p>The reason I'm asking is because when I modify the Player input to have unassigned elements for hand, it fails the autograder test. The unit test given to us doesn't check the the hand either, it only checks hand_size and name.</p></TEXT>

<p>Can the pack file contain cards below 9? e.g. Two of Spades</p>

Player_add_card</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Assume the cards are all moved to the front of the hand and any open spaces are at the back of the hand. Likewise, when you get to functions that remove cards, make sure you move up remaining cards to the front if the removed card came from the middle.</p></TEXT>

<p>WOW I totally forgot we had that variable. Thank you so much!!!!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How do you check if there is an open space? I think that's what I'm doing wrong.

I also tried checking if the card == NULL but that didn't work either. Any tips?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're just adding a card to the first open slot. You can't have more than 5 cards in a hand so creating aan array to hold 6 doesn't really help. Also, the requires clause says that the hand can't have more than 5 cards before you add the card.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>A lot of the other piazza responses have said to initialize the hand at 0 elements though... so won't you have to expand the hand in order to put anything in at all?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The hand array has size 5. It always has size 5. That's how arrays work. The hand size is the number of cards in the hand. The idea of having hand size &lt;5 is so that when you get to a situation where you're looping through cards in the hand you don't check the cards that aren't "in the hand". Once a card is assigned to the hand "playing" it doesn't remove it from the array. You just make it so the player can't "seee" those cards. When you add a card you adjust the hand size to accommodate that so later on when you're looking at the hand you can see all the cards there.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're supposed to initialize to 0 because when you initialize there are no cards in the hand.</p></TEXT>

you are correct it should be initialized in pack_init. take a look at pack.h where we declare what a pack struct is. it contains an array of type Card and it contains a pointer to a Card so you should initialize both those things on pack_init. it doesn't make sense to initialize either of them anywhere else</TEXT>

<p>cards[i] gives you a Card, not a pointer to a Card. The -&gt; only works with pointers. You need to decide whether you want a Card or a pointer to a Card. If you want a Card, you need to use dot (.) notation, not -&gt;. If you want a pointer to a Card, you need to figure out how you find a pointer to cards[i].</p></TEXT>

<p>I can't figure out how to access the suit of the same color as up card. One of my ideas is to use the enum suit indices and do [suit of upcard] + 2 to get the ordered up suit. But this is problematic if the upcard has suit CLUBS or DIAMONDS (enum indices 2 and 3), since if you add 2 to those you'd go outside the bounds of the enum. </p>

I believe you're right that by passing in the dealer as constant in this function prevents you from making this change here, however, I think the intention is just that the dealer would receive the upcard and discard the lowest card elsewhere in the code.

Will Pack.in has more than 24 cards or less than 24?</TEXT>

<p>Does the left bower count as "a face card of that suit" ? </p>

<p>For example,</p>
<p>The player has these cards in their hand: Jack of Hearts, and all other cards are spades </p>
<p>If the upcard is a Heart, then in round 2, the player will consider ordering up Diamonds. Do we count the Jack of Hearts as a face card of Diamonds since it's the left bower?</p>
<p>So basically, would the player order up diamonds as trump or not?</p></TEXT>

Making trump in round 2</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the spec, it says "if the trump suit is order up during round one, the dealer receives it." </p>

<p>What is "it"? The upcard? </p>

<p>The spec also says "he then discards the lowest card among his hand and the turn up"</p>

<p>What is "the turn up"?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Player_add_and_discard</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>"it" refers to the up card that is the next card in the deck</p>

<p>so the max size of a player's hand is 5 so the dealer needs to discard one of the cards from his hand so when he is forced to take the up card into his hand his hand size is still 5 after the discard. The wording is a little funny but it means that you can either discard a card from the player's hand or you can choose to discard the up card according to what the spec says you should discard for round 1</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes and yes. The upcard isn't picked up in the second round, and the only person potentially picking up the upcard in the first round in the dealer.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>this person ^ knows what's up</p></TEXT>

For the Player_Play Card function,  I am getting a segmentation fault.  
I am first checking to see if the Card has the same suit as the suit of the led card.  Then, I am using Card_compare(&amp;cardCheck,&amp;(player_ptr-&gt;hand[i]),trump) if the suit is not the same.
I just don't understand the spec: "If a player can follow suit, he can play the highest card that follows suit.  Otherwise, he plays the lowest card in his hand.  We did 3 compare functions which all determine different orderings, so which one should we use?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Player_Play_Card Segmentation fault</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>which compare function takes into account both both the led card and the trump card? that is probably the compare function you want to use</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>exactly your compare function that takes into account the led card should already do this so you should just be able to call the function to decide what your highest card is  that should be player, if it's not the same suit then you have to do something else to find the lowest card.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
The compare function that takes into account both the led and trump cards first checks trump suit before anything else.  However, we want to play a card that has a priority on matching the led suit.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>that makes sense because if you are playing the lowest card you don't have a card the same suit to follow the led card so the player hand would only contain the other three suits </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
The only part I'm stuck on is "if it's not the same suit then you have to do something else to find the lowest card."  Does that take into account the led suit?  I would think it just takes into account the trump suit.</TEXT>

<p>The ordering of cards in a hand doesn't matter - i.e. a hand of Nine Spades, Jack Diamonds is the same thing as a hand of Jack Diamonds, Nine Spades. So yes you could just replace the discarded card with the added card.</p></TEXT>

<p>Well yes if the lead suit is the trump suit then a given player will follow suit and play a trump card.

 <TEXT>
<p>or if the player got really lucky and only has trump cards in their hand then the lowest card in their hand would also be a trump and thus be played.</p>

<p>Just realized that the previous post was nonsensical. However, the above question is still relevant.</p></TEXT>

<p>The RME does not require that the player will have 5 cards in his/her hand, so your function should not assume that will be the case.</p></TEXT>

<p>Because we have multiple main function in this project, when I want to test a Card.cpp, how can the compiler know which function it should call?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
How to run multiple main function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you can't have more than one main function in a file and you can't compile more than one main file (a file with a main function in it). So when you compile just compile with one file that contains main(). We gave you three so you could unit test your functions you need to write for the check point and we also gave you another Makefile so look in the make file for the compile commands to compile each unit test program. And I highly recommend using the Makefile to compile because it's easier and faster </p>

<p>Short answer</p>
<p>The compile will only accept at most one main function being compiled and so you should only tell it to compile one main file.</p></TEXT>

<p>Is passing the published test files the only tests we need to pass in order to pass all 3 of the p3 autograder tests?  or are there additional tests?</p>

<p>I have passed all of the published tests in the test.cpp's, but still am not passing the player portion of the autograder.  I have written additional test and passed  also, but still getting a Fail for player.</p>

<p>Thank You!</p></TEXT>

<p>For the fstream code that Professor DeOrio told us to explicitly copy into our code and modify ourselves when necessary, where/how do we use this code? I've only finished Card.cpp so far and I have not run into the issue of using this tidbit yet.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Very inexperienced programmer here aside from Engineering 101.  Where in the world do I even begin to actually write code, the spec confuses me more and more every time I read it.  Im just asking an honest question, as I really don't know where to even start with this project. If at all possible, what are some good starting points and tips to get started?</p>

<p>Thanks a ton.</p>

Start Coding</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Did you complete project 2?</p>

<p>-------</p>
<p>Start with Card.cpp. In the spec, they have a section that says "how to start this project."</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>I agree that the spec's 15+ pages is pretty overwhelming at first, so here are some tips for organizing your thoughts.</p>
<ul><li>First, note that the spec recommends that you code the files in a particular order: Card.cpp first, then Pack.cpp, etc (pages 8-9). I don't really think there's any other way to do this because the functions you write in Card.cpp will be used in every other file you write. So start there.</li><li>Note that among the many files you have to download, there's a Card.cpp.starter file included with (most of) the functions for Card.cpp already implemented. Read their RMES, figure out what they do, etc; then plan out how you're going to implement the rest of the functions in Card.cpp.</li><li>Once you start implementing the rest of the functions in Card.cpp, MAKE SURE to test everything you write right away in Card_tests.cpp! Actually, even in the spec it's recommended that you write tests for your functions before implementing them, so then you know exactly what to expect and aren't tricking yourself into thinking that your code is right when it's not. Plus if your Card functions are buggy then it's highly likely the rest of your files will also be buggy.</li><li>Besides actual coding, the really important thing is that you understand how the game works, which is why it's recommended to learn how to play euchre (if you're not already familiar with it). Then you can translate your knowledge of the game into logical programming.</li></ul>

<p>I hope this gives you some ideas!! Also, I obviously don't have all the answers so I'm sure other people can make some contributions.</p></TEXT>

<p>Test cases are not specifically graded at the checkpoint.</p>
<p>However, if you're coding the way the spec tells you to (which is generally a good idea), you <span style="text-decoration:underline">will</span> write test cases for Card, Pack, and Player before Wednesday, because you will write your test cases before you write your functions.

<p>I have the new XCode too... mine works the same as before. I renamed pack.in to pack.txt, not sure if that makes a difference... Are you sure you have the right library included?

<p>Is the next card equivalent to the card on top of the deck. For example when dealing one, should next refer to the card that is now left at the top of the pack?</p>

 <TEXT>
Next card</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It should start at the beginning of the pack and gradually work its way up as cards are dealt.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Right, when you deal one, you're dealing the next card (the top of the deck), and then you also have to update next, so that in future calls you don't keep dealing the same card.</TEXT>

<p>How does assert work?  I get that it will crash a program is whatever is in the brackets returns false, so if we put assert in our test cases, the program will stop running at that point?  </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Assert (General Question)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If the assert is ever reached with its paramater holding a false value, the program will stop running at that point.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Sounds like you've both got it, whenever the parameter evaluates to false the program stops there, and prints something out to tell you about the failed assert causing termination. If you're asking why this is useful, it can help with automated testing, so that if you don't get the expected result, something like assert(EXPECTED_RESULT == ACTUAL_RESULT) will fail and exit. You know everything works / all your test cases pass if you reach the end of the program normally. In some places in the code, assert(0) is also used, which always fails/exits. These are put in places in the code so you can tell if program control is reaching a point that you never wanted to get to during execution, like if you miss all the cases of a switch or if, else if, ... It prints out a helpful message so you can fix it, so it's better than the problem going unnoticed.</TEXT>

<p>In the project spec, it says:</p>

<p>If a player can follow suit, he plays the highest card that follows suit.  Otherwise, he plays the <br />lowest card in his hand. <br /><br /></p>

<p>When a player considers following suit, barring the trump suit does not match lead suit, does he consider his trump cards as being suit cards since they are stronger than the suit cards, or does he solely consider suit cards? Any help would be appreciated!</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>So I'm trying to work with the initial work of pack_init, following the steps done in IO lecture from last week</p>
<p>So I start by taking in the char* pack_filename, I transfer it to another char called filename<br />I then create an ifstream called filestream</p>
<p>Then, I try to open the file through filestream, with filestream.open(filename.c_str()), as the slides suggest, and all sources on the Internet do<br />But when I try to compile, it says "request for member ‘c_str’ in ‘filename’, which is of non-class type ‘const char’ "<br />What do I do about this?</p>
<p>My interpretation is that the error is reading the .cs_str to be a call within filename, but I've included all the given files tasked to us. Is this just another problem caused by using Ubuntu?</p>
<p>.open() requires a cstring, filename is just a char, and .c_str() is supposed to give a string representation</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
c_str() not in filename</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're trying to call c_str() (a C++ string function) on a char * (a c string). Take out the ".c_str()" and it'll work. Remember, you only want to call .c_str() when you need a c-string (type char*) and you only have a c++ string (type string).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The second parameter for pack_init is of type const char*, which is a C-string - so you don't need to do any conversion with .c_str(). You can just call filestream.open() directly with the parameter.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>All right, thank you very much!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>However, when I remove the .c_str(), the compiler says there is "no matching function for call to ‘std::basic_ifstream&lt;char&gt;::open(char&amp;)’ ", and points to the end of filestream.open(filename);</p>
<p>Which, for its solution, the internet recommends using .c_str()</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is your pack.in in the right directory?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>sorry, could you specify what you mean by that? if I'm working in Xcode, do you know what folder would it needs to be in?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So in your project folder there should be a sub-folder called "Derived Data" I believe, and one of its subfolders is called "Build/Products/Debug". If you put your pack.in there it should read properly.</p>

<p>Also, I'm not at a computer at the moment so I might not be remembering the names of the folders exactly right. Hopefully this works for you, but let me know if you're still having problems!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I made the above-stated changes to my Pack_init function, but it now returns with exit failure (i.e. open is failing). I believe I followed all the right steps to opening the file, including declaring an input filestream, and opening that ifstream with the passed pack_filename. Any ideas on why it's not opening? </p></TEXT>

So in the make trump function:
134     Suit *suitptr = &amp;(Suit_next(upcard-&gt;suit));
135     order_up_suit = suitptr;
In function ‘bool Player_make_trump(const Player*, const Card*, const Player*, int, Suit*)’:
Player.cpp:134: error: lvalue required as unary ‘&amp;’ operand
I tried doing it without the &amp; and it failed as well.  I don't get how to mess with a Suit pointer.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Suit *order_up_suit</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't know if this will be the correct answer, but it might help to try to declare a seperate variable equal to Suit_next, then use that variable. You can try it out. I think that I was getting similar errors with other declarations because the &amp;Suit_next is temporary.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Cool. What was it that was happening incorrectly?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Upcard is a const pointer and Suit next takes in a non const suit.  You can't pass in a const pointer as a non const parameter.
I think the conclusion is const pointers point to const variables, so  upcard-&gt;suit is a const suit.</TEXT>

<p>In round 1 the dealer is a normal player. In round 2 the dealer orders the next suit no matter what. Everyone else has their strategy outlined in the spec.</p></TEXT>

<p>The spec says that a person will order up if they have two or more face cards of the shown suit, but that in round 2 if they have one face card of the same suit as the shown they will order up. So, if a player has one face card of the shown suit, do they order up on round 2 the shown suit. like if a 9 of hears o is up and a player has a king of hearts, they won't order up round one for hearts, but do they order hearts on round 2?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
make trump function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Read the spec carefully. In the second round of making trump, the rejected suit from round one (in your example, hearts) can no longer be trump. So in round 2, the only suit that will be considered as a potential trump suit is the suit of the same color as the upcard - in your example, diamonds.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, for the purposes of this project (probably just to simplify debugging) the only other suit that will be considered for trump in round two is the the suit of the same color as the upcard.</p></TEXT>

<p>so the other players never order up a suit other than one with the same color as the up card? it says they can in the beginning but only gives a condition for which they call a trump that is the same color as the up card</p>

<p>I have written in my notes that we should use the fstream code from Lecture 8 for Pack_init. But in that function, the filename is already a string, whereas Pack_init is passed const char* pack_filename. I tried using .c_string( ) to convert this to a  string, but I get an error message. How do you use the passed pack_filename pointer to open the file? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Pack_init filename</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Const char* is a C string.</p>
<p>Say you have a fstream variable called johnny and a file called euchre (names are very different for clarity). The correct syntax is johnny.open(euchre) (which was in the slides).  If euchre is a string (which file names frequently are) you have to convert to a C string since open only takes C strings as parameters. The .c_str() function you mentioned is a member function of the string library. Given euchre is a string, how do you call a string member function on that variable? I think this was in lecture 8 but the variable names etc might have made it unclear.</p>
<p>Always feel free to look these up on cplusplus.org. They aren't "standard library" but they're standard enough that the full documentation of syntax and such is there.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
player_make_trump</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Suit order_up_suit is the suit that is chosen to be trump after Player_make _trump returns true.</p>

<p>You will first initialize it to any suit (temporarily) before passing it through to Player_make_trump and you will assign it a value when a player decides to make trump. Think of it as passing that value by reference, but by using a pointer instead.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so, for example, I could put in SPADES for that parameter?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can't know (although, you might technically know because the specs are very limited when it comes to what suits can be ordered up) what suit will be ordered up before trump is made. Assume you don't know the answer, and have your function return the answer in that variable.</p></TEXT>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For your last parameter of your function call, you're passing in a literal value of SPADES. The function takes a pointer - order_up_suit is potentially being modified by the function. You can't modify the value SPADES; you need an actual variable.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>I'm confused when the specs say to change the order-up-suit to the desired to suit.. When the order up suit its passed to the function, it should already be assigned to a suit, and when a player decides to make that card the trump suit, the order up suit is already assigned to the desired suit..

<p>It depends on what was lead.  If clubs was lead, the Ace of Hearts would lose to the King of Clubs.  But if Hearts was lead, the King of Clubs would lose to the Ace of Hearts.  For non trump cards, they follow the normal face values Ace &lt; King &lt; Queen &lt; Jack &lt; Ten &lt; Nine and they must follow the lead suit for that trick.  For example, if Diamonds is trump, and the King of Clubs is lead, everyone would have to play a club if they have one, but if someone did not have a club and chose to play the Ace of Hearts it would still lose to the King of Clubs because it is not trump and is not the suit that was lead.  </p>

<p>Sorry if this is a lot, tried to explain it the best I could.  Best of luck</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Student answer is good, but brings up a good point about the lead card.</p>

<p>There are 3 cases concerning the lead card:</p>
<p>1.) King of Clubs is lead card: If this is the case, the King will beat the Ace of Hearts</p>
<p>2.) Ace of Hearts is lead card: If this is the case, the Ace will beat the King.</p>
<p>3.) Neither are the lead card: If the lead card was something else, then it depends on lead card suit</p>
<ul><li>Lead is Hearts: Ace will win</li><li>Lead is Clubs: King will win</li><li>Lead is Spades or Diamonds: Although the King and Ace may have to be compared, it is impossible for them to beat whatever the lead card is (see spec for more details)</li></ul></TEXT>

<p>From lecture, we decided that we don't need to modify anything in Flatland.cpp...</p>

<p>My question though is, haven't we changed the way to construct a triangle? So when you make a triangle, your third argument has to be an angle in radians and not a side?</p>

<p>I understand how we can convert the angle to a side c to use within Triangle.cpp using some trig, but my question is why Triangle(a,b,c) still works if the constructor is Triangle(a,b,angle) when using the triangle constructor in Flatland.cpp.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
About redefining a triangle to be 2 sides and an angle...</TEXT>

<p>No, the idea in lecture was that we do not touch the constructors. I.e. we compute the angle from a, b, and c so that we do not need to change the constructors.</p></TEXT>

For example, have you manually shuffled a deck and made sure that your shuffle function outputs the cards in the right order? Have you written test cases that deal several cards, making sure they're the right ones, then reset the pack?</p>

 <TEXT>
Dereference Operator/ pointer clarification</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you use the * when you are either declaring a pointer or when you need to dereference a pointer (get at the memory address the pointer points to) </p>
<p>when you just need to do stuff to the pointer itself you do not use the *, you just use the name of the pointer</p>

<p>you can declare pointers two valid ways and they both do the same thing</p>
<p>int* ptr</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>int *ptr</p>

<p>perhaps declaring it the first way might clear up confusion in the future</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Do note that it might logically make sense to write <tt>int* ptr</tt> as it's then easy to read as "<tt>ptr</tt> is a variable of type <tt>int*</tt>", but this might trip you up later, if you write a line like this one:</p>
<pre>int* a, b, c;</pre>
<p>One would expect that this logically (following the previous argument) creates three pointers to ints. In fact, this creates <tt>a</tt> an int pointer, and <tt>b</tt> and <tt>c</tt> integers. To create three int pointers, one would need to write :</p>

So I'm trying to find the bug in my code that makes my player.cpp fail the autograder.  The spec says:
"Each other hand must follow the led suit, if able, and otherwise may play any card."
Does this mean if player 1 leads a card, player 2 doesnt have to follow the led suit but player 3 does?  Why would the spec say "otherwise may play any card"?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
player_play_card function unclear wording</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Think of it as "Each other player must follow the led suit if she has one or more cards of that suit. If she has no other cards of that suit, she is allowed to play any card in her hand." Player 2's ability or inability to play the led suit does not affect player 3's ability or inability to play it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're right that it can seem a bit unclear. The rules of euchre (as defined in the spec on page 2) say that the player may play "any" card if he can't follow suit. The strategy we're asking you to have your players use (as described on page 3 of the spec) says that if the player is given this choice, he will choose the lowest card in his hand. What you need to code in Player.cpp is a player that uses the strategy.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
But doesn't the spec say the player has to play the lowest card in his hand if he cannot follow suit?  Therefore, the player is not allowed to play "any" card in his hand.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Do we we have to write test cases for the functions in Card.h that have already been implemented?  Or do we only have to write test cases for the functions that we implement ourselves?</p></TEXT>

<p>assuming your card is the last one in the hand array, then you could just decrement the size. Otherwise I imagine you'd need some way to rearrange the cards in the hand. I'm not exactly sure on the best way to do that myself. I'm thinking memcpy might be what we're supposed to use?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
You don't need to overwrite the cards at the end of the array with uninitialized cards; if you decrement hand_size and are careful not to read past it, it shouldn't matter what cards you have at the end of the array. <div>I wouldn't recommend memcpy for rearranging the cards in a hand.

One problem that's been common has been to try to access the ith element in the cards array with just cards[i], which isn't defined by itself, but since it's an attribute of the Pack that pack_ptr points to, pack_ptr-&gt;cards[i] successfully gets the ith card. Maybe you're calling the card functions on this? Another possibility might be that the parameters are Card* rather than Card, so if you pass it in without being a pointer it wouldn't match the function you've defined.</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>To be honest with you. Even though I know how to use GDB, I haven't really needed to use it. I use Visual Studio Pro (Microsoft gives it for free) and it does a pretty good job at debugging. I would suggest that you try start programming functions one step at a time (one function at a time), run it, ensure it works and move to next function.</p>

<p>If you are having a segmentation fault, then you are trying to access somewhere you should not. Check for array boundaries and null pointers.</p>

<p>If you still need to read about GDB this link will teach it, and if you read the whole thing you will learn a ton of other useful things (regarding memory) as well: http://www.dirac.org/linux/gdb/</p>

<p>However, I would still appreciate if an instructor would explain me why would I need GDB if I have Visual Studio debugger (often pointing the exact line where the problem occurs), I would appreciate it as well.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You don't need GDB but it is a debugger that is included in CAEN so it's just a go to that we know everyone has access to. If you are happy with your fancy visual debugger in Visual Studio or any other IDE then feel free to use those (I personally love eclipse's debugger). We just want you to know how to use one because debugging is a very important skill to know!</p></TEXT>

<p>I googled SCP Tutorial and found the following reference for transferring files from a server (read: CAEN) to the localhost (read: your comp).</p>

<p>"You can also copy a file (or multiple files) from the (remote) server to your own computer. Let’s have a look at an example of that:</p>

<p>[pineehad@localhost ~]$ scp yourusername@yourserver:/home/yourusername/examplefile .</p>

<p><em>Note: The dot at the end means the current local directory. This is a handy trick that can be used about everywhere in Linux. Besides a single dot, you can also type a double dot ( .. ), which is the parent directory of the current directory.</em></p>
<p>This will copy the file “/home/yourusername/examplefile” to the current directory on your own computer, provided that the username and password are correct and that the file actually exists."</p>

<p>I want to clarify what is meant by "lowest card" in the specs.</p>
<p>If the card is ordered up, it says the lowest card is discarded.</p>
<p>Does this mean the card with the lowest value? (i.e the 9 of diamonds would be the lowest if the player had this card) or does it just mean the lowest number? (i.e a player would discard the 9 of trump before discarding the ace of another suit)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Player_make_trump Function -- Lowest Card</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It means the lowest card in value relative to the trump suit that has just been declared. So the dealer wouldn't discard the 9 of trump, unless every other card in his/her hand was stronger than the 9 of trump. Also, note that there's a possibility that the dealer could actually discard the upcard in the case that the upcard was lower in value than all of the other cards in his/her hand.</p>

<p>Edit: yes note that in Player_make_trump you're not actually going to be modifying any player's hand. But keep in mind what it means for the "lowest" card to be discarded for the purposes of this project - it means the lowest card in value out of the 6, including the upcard.</p></TEXT>

<p>within the add and discard function we need to use card compare to figure out if one has a better value than the other.

 <TEXT>
add_discard function with trump</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The add_discard function is only called after the upcard has been declared trump, so the suit of the upcard is trump.  </p></TEXT>

<p>Open the checkpoint-submit.tar.gz file and confirm that all of the expected files are in there. Check capitalization of the file names, etc. There's not much more I can think of beyond that.</p></TEXT>

<p>I think what you do, provided we can use the test cases for our own tests, is just copy the code into our own test files.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you are testing with the checkpoint files, the file names don't match what you need to compile for the autograder (card_test00.cpp != card_tests.cpp...).  Maybe that is your problem?</p>

<p>Still would like to know about the necessity of writing our own test cases, though.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Yes, you still have to turn in your own test cases and they should be different from those in the autograder tests.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>James Perretta - I've heard conflicting answers for this. Others have said that we don't need our own test cases for the checkpoint (and other instructors have endorsed their answers). Are they mistaken, are you, or am I misunderstanding something?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>^ wondering the same thing also.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>According to the spec, all we turn in is the 3 cpp files along with group.txt. Is this wrong then?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>^ Hmm... interesting.</p>

<p>Are you reading the spec from the Google drive or the prof's website? I know the PDF on the website only specifies the 3 files, but the Google drive spec that we're supposed to use list them AND the test files...</p>

<p>What I've heard is that, they wouldn't test our test cases against buggy code to grade these "_tests" files. But then, like someone else said, the project is supposed to be test-driven. Plus, you need the test cases for the final submission anyway. So that's what I'm working on, now, too!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>^ Ahh yes, I had an older version of the spec somehow.  It seems like it would be wise of them to be sure there is only one set of instructions for the project out there, as that would clear up all the unnecessary confusion.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So do we have to turn in our own test cases at the checkpoint? Also, are these test cases you posted all of the ones we are expected to pass for the autograder for the checkpoint? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>See above.  I believe the filename needed to pass the autograder is Player_tests, not Player_test00.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>it is not the same. I also turn in my own tests. I don't miss any files. </p>

Well, the upcard's suit is clubs, so the player will look to see if he has any spades or or the left-bower, which is also a face trump. The player has a Jack of Spades, which is a face trump since it is the right-bower, so he will order up.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Jack of Spades is the same suit as clubs only if the trump is clubs. In round 2, the trump is no longer considered to be clubs. The player will see that they have a face card (Jack) in spades and order up.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In round 2, the trump suit hasn't been decided yet, so the possible trump suit is the suit of the same colored opposite suit of the upcard, which is the QUEEN OF CLUBS in this case.

It's a similar check to round 1, but imagine the considered trump suit as the same colored opposite suit as the upcard.</p></TEXT>

<p>So, I have written all my code for the checkpoint and tried submitting it to the auto grader, but I get a compile error on player_tests. I wrote the code in sublime text and was able to compile and run it on my mac terminal, compiling it with g++. To see if my compiling was different from that of a caen linnux environment, i sent the code to my caen desktop via an scp command line, then i moved to my terminal in caen with a ssh command. Once there I re compiled and was able to, but when i ran it i got the error "cannot execute binary file" I was wondering if this happened in the auto grader and thats why it didn't work? Keeping in mind that my other two .cpp files passed the autograder</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Compile error</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No, the auto grader has the header files, so you don't need to submit them. But you should submit all .cpp files</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thats not what I meant. I know that I submit the make tar-checkpoint file and thats it. What I was asking is could the compile error be a result of not having  #include "something.h" at the top of one of my cpp files? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Generically it is certainly possible that missing an #include line can cause compiler errors.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>update: I have passed all the published auto grader tests for player.cpp (the ones just posted to the google drive) could this be a problem related to not including the right things in the top of the file? aka the #includes??</p></TEXT>

<p>Marking as answered.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The posted test cases included:</p>

<p>assert(Card_compare(&amp;ace_diamonds, &amp;ace_hearts, &amp;nine_diamonds, HEARTS) &lt; 0);</p>

<p>This suggests to me that if:</p>
<p>Card A= Ace Diamonds</p>
<p>Card B = Ace of Hearts</p>
<p>Led Card = 9 Diamonds</p>
<p>Trump = Hearts</p>

<p>Then Card B has a higher value than Card A.</p>

<p>However, if a heart is led, shouldn't following suit be MORE important than a trump card?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Posted Card_tests00</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Following suit may be more important while actually playing the game (i.e. if a player has a card of the lead suit, then he/she must play it) but in terms of suit value, trump is always highest. </p>

<p>So in your example, if the led card were Nine Diamonds, trump were Hearts, and a player had only Ace of Hearts and Ace of Diamonds, then yes the player would have to play Ace of Diamonds - but the value of Ace of Hearts would still be greater, which is what is being tested in this case.</p></TEXT>

<p>if I use Card_Compare(jack_clubs, queen_spades) it should return &gt; 1 because spades is less than club. But its not.. Not sure if I'm the problem or the function is actually buggy at that case? </p>

<p>Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Card_compare function that is given</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That is actually correct. The rank takes precedence over the suit.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If thats true then why should we return a queen of diamonds instead of one of the lower ranked cards in bob's hand:</p>

<pre>// Bob has all spades, so he should play the min if Diamonds is led
  Card nine_diamonds = {NINE, DIAMONDS};
  Card card_played = Player_play_card
    (&amp;bob,            //Bob plays the card
     &amp;nine_diamonds,  //Diamonds is led
     SPADES);         //Spades is trump
  assert(Card_compare(&amp;card_played, &amp;queen_spades) == 0);</pre>
<p>If led is diamond, and he has all spades, shouldn't he play the lowest ranked card (which at this point is a jack of clubs)? instead of a queen of spades? Also since spades is the trump card shouldn't he play the highest spade card in his hand? </p>

<p>-confused- </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is there a difference between using -&gt; to check if a card's suit is trump or Card_is_trump? If there isn't, which one is preferred? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
-&gt; or function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think it would ultimately depend on the context. Say Hearts is trump and you have the Jack of Diamonds in your hand. Then -&gt; will tell you that the Jack of Diamonds' suit is Diamonds, while Card_is_trump will just return true because a left bower is considered a trump card. I suppose you could also just check if the card is the left bower using the function Card_is_left_bower, but then again you'd save yourself a few lines just using Card_is_trump.</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the second card_compare do we still return 0 if A and B are the same cards but led_card is different? Another scenario that I have in question is how about if led_card is the same as A but B is different, what should it return?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
card_compare(a,b,led_card,trump)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>All of the card compare functions should return 0 <strong>only </strong>when A and B's rank <em>and</em> suit are the same.</p>

<p>For the second scenario, it depends on whether or not B is also in the led suit. How the cards should be ordered can be found in the spec.</p>

<p>Card_print(&amp;card)</p>

<p>Screw the dealer is invoked in the second round of make_trump when it becomes the dealer's turn. However, according to the RME, NO CARDS are ADDED or DISCARDED to the DEALER's HAND in the make_trump function.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Exactly.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Awesome, thanks guys</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
dealer is a constant pointer to a player.  You can't change his cards inside the make_trump function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From project3.pdf:</p>



<p>From Euchre Rules:</p>
<p>If making reaches the dealer during the second round, a variant called screw the dealer is invoked. The dealer must order up a suit other than the rejected suit.</p>


<p>From Euchre Strategy:</p>
<p>If making reaches the dealer during the second round, we invoke screw the dealer, where the dealer is forced to order up. In the case of screw the dealer, the dealer will always order up the suit with the same color as the up card.</p>




<p>From what I understand from the above statements, in screw the dealer, the dealer must order up the same-colored opposite suit of the upcard.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Im very confused about how to deal with screw the dealer in make trump function. This is how I understand it, please correct me if Im wrong:</p>

<p>If the player and the dealer is the same and it is round 2 of making then the dealer must order up a suit that is not the rejected suit. But how do we know which suit the dealer will order, and if we dont know this how do we modify order up suit accordingly? so assume the upcard is of suit heartss and screw teh dealer has been invoked, do we need to look through the dealers cards to find a card that is of diamonds? or in this case would we simply change the order up suit to diamonds? Is diamonds the ONLY possible value for order up suits in this scenario?</p>

<p>Thanks!! :D</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe that 'true' will be returned because the dealer has ordered up a suit.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>and just the face that screw teh dealer is invoked means that false will be returned, correcT?</p></TEXT>

<p>I ask these questions in light of DeOrio posting the unit tests for all the functions for everyone to see today.</p>

<p>Are these test cases all of the test cases we have to pass in order to get full credit on the checkpoint? </p>

<p>Also, are we still required to write our own test cases to turn in for the checkpoint?</p>

<p>I understand from previous piazza questions and answers that for the final turn in (not the checkpoint), we will have to pass more rigorous test cases, and we will be expected to develop better test cases to account for this. Is this understanding correct?</p>

<p>The now publicly available test cases appear to be the exact ones that the checkpoint autograder is using (this may be false, see followup discussion for someone claiming this is false). That is, if you pass them, then you will pass the autograder.</p>

<p>I'm almost certain that I've read instructor responses on Piazza indicating that we don't need to have our own test cases done for the checkpoint, however if you are following the specs suggestion to write tests before writing functions you should have your own test cases complete. @882</p>

<p>When i = 4, awesome_spade_hand + 4 passes a pointer pointed to the last element to the function Player_has_card_in_hand . In function Player_has_card_in_hand, the pointer will be accessed 5 times to access the five cards.</p>

<p>However, the pointer only points to a card array that has 5 cards,. This visits an empty pointer when i is larger than 1. Will this cause a problem? </p>

<p>I'm running into a very strange, consistent error when trying to test Player_lead_card. The function seems to, in some way, add a space and an end-of-transmission character(ASCII value 0004) to the name of the player passed to the function. This causes the <tt>strcmp(alice.name, "Alice") = 0 </tt>assert at the beginning of Player_tests.cpp to evaluate to false, exiting the test program. I've rewritten the function 3 times with completely different structures in an attempt to figure out what's accessing alice.name that shouldn't be, but I've had no luck so far. Nothing seems to be going off the end of its respective array or anything like that, so I'm stumped. Has anyone else had a similar problem with this function?</p>

<p>Update: omitting the -O1 flag from the command when compiling Player_tests solves the problem. Does the autograder use this flag? How can I fix this to work with O1?</p>

<p>Quick question on Pack_init. I am using getline to get the suit and rank for each card and then have been splitting them into separate char with strtok. I have also been using x as a counter so I can traverse the Cards array within the pointer struct.</p>

<p>When I go to implement Card_init(pack_ptr-&gt;cards[x], rank, suit) (suit and rank are the split char). I get this error: error C2665: 'Card_init' : none of the 2 overloads could convert all the argument types.</p>

<p>I think I'm calling the pack_ptr wrong, but I don't know how to fix it. Any help would be appreciated!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Pack_init question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
I think it's the way you're calling Card_init. The first argument should be a Card*, but pack_ptr-&gt;cards[x] is a Card. If you use &amp; to get the location of that card, you can pass that in instead.
If that doesn't fix it, you're also doing the reading from the file differently than I did, so it's possible the char types for suit and rank are slightly different than the function expects.</TEXT>

<p>I am having a very odd problem with shuffle. The function pretty much works, all the cards are in the right order. The first card is correct, however the only incorrect card is the last card. It should be Jack of Spades, but it is an out of order Nine of Spades. I am printing out the cards so I can error check, and somehow, my function has created another Nine of Spades in place of the Jack of Spades. Any possible explanations for this?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Shuffle Problem</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hm, I would check where you are making copies of the cards. Somehow a nine of spades was copied into an incorrect spot and it stayed there!</p>

<p>I get the pack to read from pack.in and initialise all the cards in the pack properly on Windows, but when I compile in Linux the entire pack gets initialised to "Two of Spades".

Playing strategy</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>1) You only play trump when it is the led card or when it is among the lowest cards left in your hand.</p>

<p>2) Trump suit always includes left bower.  Check the unit tests for Player.cpp that they provided, you'll see that they included a test case of all trump, including right and left bower, and that you need to make sure you don't accidentally play left bower instead of right (since they're all trump).  I assume you play the highest of whatever suit is led, regardless of whether the led suit is trump or not.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm having trouble understanding what it means to "initialize card *next" in pack.cpp. From what I gathered it sounds like you just make *next equal to the first card of the pack.</p>

<p>My card_init for cards[i] looks like this:</p>
<p>Card_init(&amp;pack_ptr-&gt;cards[i], rank, suit);</p>

<p>and it works so I assumed the init for *next would just look like this:</p>

<p>Card_init(&amp;pack_ptr-&gt;*next, rank, suit); (using if selection so it happens for just the first card). However, it's saying next is not declared in this scope. Any help?</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
initialize card *next question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>(You don't want to refer to *next.  *next is saying you're pointing to a value -- in Pack_init, at least, you're not pointing at anything yet.)</p>

<p>I think the reason you're getting the scope message is that the * before next breaks it off of pack_ptr.  It's a part of pack_ptr, it can't be broken off.  (If you had assigned a pointee for next already, I'm pretty sure you would refer to its value by *pack_ptr-&gt;next, not pack_ptr-&gt;*next.)  Additionally, I don't believe you need an ampersand in your call.  pack_ptr-&gt;next is already a pointer, it is already (meant to be) referring to a memory location.  You only need an ampersand when calling with pack_ptr-&gt;cards[i] because pack_ptr-&gt;cards[i] refers to a value, not a memory location.  (On a related note, you can use pack_ptr-&gt;cards to refer to the location of the first element of the array -- but not the value of the first element of the array.  Is this making sense?)</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm a little unclear how play works between hands.  I <em>think</em> the way it works is that, within a hand, each player loses one of their cards, until everyone has zero cards; at this point, the majority of the cards have been discarded and there are only a couple remaining.  What happens next?  Does the pack get reset?  If shuffle was off at the beginning of the game, do we shuffle between hands?  (If we don't shuffle between hands, we'll just keep getting the same result over and over... unless, possibly, we're supposed to shift the remaining cards to the beginning and add in the discarded cards to the end.)  At the beginning of each hand, we go through one or two rounds of making.  Is this correct?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Quick gameplay question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>After each hand, the pack is reset (you wrote a function to do this) and depending on whether or not shuffle is enabled, the pack is shuffled. You're correct when you say that if shuffle is disabled, then each hand would be the same.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each hand you make trump as specified in the spec.</p></TEXT>

<p>More or less. I would recommend sitting down and writing a flow chart for the game logic of a game of euchre. See where the functions you've already written would fit into the flow chart, then figure out what helper functions you might want to create. (In my opinion, it's best to keep the actual "steps" of the game logic limited to just a line or two of code. If you think a particular step would go beyond a line or two, create a helper function to handle it instead - and there are several helper functions that need to be a few dozen lines long)</p></TEXT>

<p>If about 75% of the coding will have been done by the checkpoint, is what is mostly left understanding the logic of how a game of euchre should be played and piecing the pieces together?</p></TEXT>

<p>I was told that a comparison should be made during screw the dealer between the player pointer and dealer pointer to see if they are the same. Did anyone else do this and if so could you elaborate on why and the strategy behind this? Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Screww the dealer</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This can be handled a few different ways. The fact that dealer is being passed into the Player_make_trump function implies that we should check for the dealer during round 2 and force them to order up (thus screwing the dealer).</p>

<p>You could also handle it within your game logic by only asking the first 3 players to order up, and then automatically forcing the dealer to order up if no one else does. I would suggest doing it the first way since that is reason that dealer is passed into the function. (And we aren't sure how they will test the function for the final submission)</p></TEXT>

<p>How do we check that two pointers point to the same place?</p>

<p>assume the pointers were both of the same type and were named foo and bar would i just say</p>

<p>}  ??</p>

<p>Thank you</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
How to check if pointers are equal?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This would not compare the pointers' contents. Doing this type of comparison will only compare the memory addresses that the pointers point to.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're right OP. That's how you check if two pointers point to the same address. I believe Taha was assuming that you actually wanted to compare the pointer's contents, but that doesn't seem to be the case from your post.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Exactly.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Isnt that the same thing in a way? becuase if both point to same address they both contain the same things?</p>

<p>to compare the values inside them would I do *foo = *bar</p></TEXT>

<p>I for the life of me can not seem to get the next pointer to work correctly.  Can anyone help explain how to initialize it and how to use it in the other functions.

 <TEXT>
*Next</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>next is an element of pack_ptr.</p>

<p>If pack_ptr is not a pointer, it is possible to access next  with the following method:</p>

<p>pack_ptr.next</p>


<p>If pack_ptr is a pointer, it is possible to access next with either of the following methods:</p>
<p>pack_ptr-&gt;next</p>
<p>(*pack_ptr).next</p>

<p>EDIT: When you initialize a pointer, you must first make it "point" to a location before trying to change it's value. In this case, it will "point" to the first card in the pack. Of course, pack must be initialized beforehand. </p></TEXT>

<p>So say a student found a partner today and wanted to work on the remainder of project 3 with said partner, after each student has already finished the work for the checkpoint on their own. Would that student and their partner need to submit the same file for this checkpoint, or could they get away with each of them submitting their own code now and then submitting the final project 3 together?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Partnering up after this checkpoint</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I might be wrong, but I think that the official policy would be that if you didn't elect to work with the partner at the beginning of the project, you can't add one on in the middle. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe the same thing as posted above. If work had already been turned in for the checkpoint then it's definitely a record that you had elected to work (or not work) with a certain partner.</p>

<p>For other projects, it may be possible to get away with adding a partner if both people started out working individually as long as nothing has previously been submitted to the autograder. The other way around won't work though because you the similarity checker would more than likely flag down your code.</p></TEXT>

<p>Think of the next pointer as pointing to the card on top of the deck of cards to be dealt out.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>^ in the pack_init, thats what I have</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I still don't know how to do this LOL. why was it resolved.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, so make next the top card at the beginning, so index 0.</p>

<p>But you need to increment the pointer so the next time you call Pack_next you get the one after that (index 1, etc).</p>

<p>A temp variable might come in handy somewhere...</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so have something like pack-&gt;next = pack-&gt;card[0], correct? I have that..</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm having trouble figuring out how to delete a card.</p>
<p>In Player_lead_card we're supposed to delete the card that has been played.  How would I go about doing this?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
How do I delete a card..?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hint: Maybe you can put another card over it. Note: Also remember that hand_size tells you how many cards are in the hand, not how many are in the hand array, you just don't look past that number. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hint: Maybe you can put another card over it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You have the ability to change hand_size at any time.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Imagine cards at indexes. How would decrementing hand_size affect a card at a certain index?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>See my post at @968. Hopefully that will help you visualize what is going on when you discard a card.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That is one way to think about it, but it isn't the most efficient way. Remember: ORDER DOESN'T MATTER. Reordering the hand after a card has been played can be done with 1 card swap. You can try figuring out this method, or use the method Tyler mentioned. It is up to your preference.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Very good point. Drawing out your solution would be a bit too obvious as to what's going on though :P</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Only way to guarantee it won't be obvious is if the drawing would be with a starting hand of 1-3 cards. :D</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok, I think I kind of understand.  But how would I reinitialize the size of the array cutting off the last variable?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>There shouldn't be a need to reinitialize the size of an array. Remember: this project was designed so we, the students, would use pointer traversal and become more comfortable with it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But my deleted card is still technically in my hand</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hint: Keep track of the position of the card that has been played. There is no need to create a new array. Things can be overwritten.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But wouldn't  the hand_size still be at the original size? I would still have to delete a card</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As of now I am going about Pack_shuffle by creating a "holder" pack initialized to the pre-shuffled pack (pointed to by pack_ptr). Then I re-assign the cards in pack to the cards in Pack_shuffle so that the pack is "cut" in the way the specs describe. In order to do this, I have 1 for loop re-assigning the first 7 cards of pack to the last 7 cards of the holder pack. But then when I try to re-assign the last 17 cards of pack to the first 17 cards of holder pack, I am getting the first 7 cards of pack repeatedly fed in from holder pack. Basically, my holder pack is changing its card values as pack_ptr does. How do I keep the holder pack's cards separate from the pack_ptr? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Pack_shuffle</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would think honestly about what you need here. Do you really need an ENTIRE pack? A Pack is just an Array of Cards and a Pointer to the first (next) card.</p></TEXT>

<p>I've heard conflicting answers for this, and I just want someone to answer definitively: do we need to make our own test cases to turn in for the checkpoint? </p>

<p>I know we need to make our own test cases for the final turn in, and that it is a good idea to have test cases for the checkpoint anyway, but what I would like to know, yes or no, are they required for the checkpoint turn in?</p>

<p>I only ask because some places say yes, and other places say no. On here it seems to be more no's than yes's, but I talked to a professor who said yes, we do need our own test cases.</p>

<p>So I'm very confused. I don't understand why I'm getting conflicting answers from people who should know the answer, since this is something so fundamental for the turn in for this project. </p>

<p>Thanks, I appreciate anyone who could clear this up for me.</p>

<p>EDIT: I don't think the current student answer answers my question. I need to know if our own test cases are required. Basically, just a yes or no answer.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I'll assume by the instructor's response that I have to submit my own test cases, although it is unclear whether or not he means submit our own test cases or the test cases DeOrio gave us.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: OK, thanks for the clarification. Now, why does @882 suggest we don't need our own test cases? There are other examples of instructors endorsing answers that suggest the same thing, that no test cases of our own are needed. I'm confused why I've needed to ask this at the eleventh hour to get a proper answer. </p></TEXT>

Test Cases gor Checkpoint</TEXT>

<p>I think it's safe to include you're own test cases, but what I'm doing is including the given test cases along with my own, which makes my testing suite all the more comprehensive!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No test cases are not needed, you just need to pass the published test cases.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I also would like a straightforward answer to this question (i.e. our own test cases: yes or no)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, you need to submit your own testcases for the checkpoint.</p>

<p>EDIT: Clarified that you need to submit your own testcases</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes,  you need to submit testcases for the checkpoint.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This was specified in the Project Spec. I posted a "clarified answer" for the person who asked for more more clarification.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If this was specified in the Project Spec, then why did instructors endorse answers that contradicted the Project Spec?</p>

<p>Also, I can't find it in the Project Spec. Can I be directed to where this is said?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From Pg. 10:</p>

<p>"For the mid­project checkpoint, submit the following files to the autograder in a tar archive called checkpoint­submit.tar.gz:</p>
<p>Card.cpp Card_tests.cpp Pack.cpp Pack_tests.cpp Player.cpp Player_tests.cpp group.txt."</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I understand we need to submit the test case files provided for us, but I don't see how your reference to the Spec clarifies that we are required to develop our own test cases that differ from the test cases provided for us. It doesn't say if we should develop our own test cases, only that we need to submit the test files (which already have test cases in them). </p>

<p>Also, if the clarification is in the Project Spec, then why did instructors endorse answers that contradict what you're saying? An example would be @882, where it suggests we don't need our own test cases for the checkpoint. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>IAs, GSIs, and instructors are human, too. We make mistakes. We misread questions and answers sometimes. The reason Andrew was quoting the spec is because it would not make sense for us to tell you to submit the test cases in your tar file if the test files only contained code that we gave you.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That makes sense. Thanks for clarifying.</p>

<p>I guess the question now becomes what the consequences will be for the students/groups who did not submit their own test cases, some of which were probably misled by the instructors' mistakes on here. Do the students lose points because of multiple instances of instructors' misreading/misunderstanding Piazza questions/answers?</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm finishing up the final player published test case, but I'm confused.  It asserts that the card played isn't the queen of spades.  But isn't that the card the player should be playing, given that the queen of spades is his mincard since spades is the trump?</p></TEXT>

  Card card_played = Player_play_card
    (&amp;bob,            //Bob plays the card

  assert(Card_compare(&amp;card_played, &amp;queen_spades) == 0);</pre>

<p>I don't know if anyone noticed this, but the shuffle function that swaps the first 17 cards with the last 7 cards in a deck 3 times does the same operation as swapping the first 3 cards with the last 21 cards. 7*3 = 21 &lt; 24, so no weird things happen with the cards. Will it be acceptable if one were to change the shuffle function to swapping the first 3 cards with the last 21 cards since this is logically equivalent to the required shuffle?</p></TEXT>

<p>It should be fine, typical programming "ideology" is that your function is a "black box" that can be given inputs and will produce outputs, with whatever happens inside the box being irrelevant. The metaphor gets more complicated when you consider side effects and global variables, and so on, but the general idea is that abstraction is good as long as your RMEs are satisfied.</p>

<p>Okay, so I wrote my player.cpp, and passed published tests. Unfortunately on auto-grader it did not compile, and no matter how much I looked I did not see a problem. I don't use anything Windows specific, I don't have unused variables, I was passing tests without a problem. What else can cause compilation error?</p></TEXT>

Compilation error</TEXT>

<p>Same here. My files compiled and were all right in my terminal. But it failed the public tests.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The most likely thing I can think of is a variable you didn't use in your test case was unused and uninitialized, and was then used in the test file. That's just an example, there are other things that could cause similar errors. Did you run the autograder tests locally or the initial tests that came with the starter files?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Unfortunately I forgot to try compile on CAEN. It took five minutes to fix cause of the problem, but it does not make much difference now.</p></TEXT>

<p>Some compilers will automatically find libraries for you but some won't. In my case, I solve this problem by adding all allowed headers to the .cpp file (although this seems not recommended).</p></TEXT>

<p>why we need to use cstring for most parts of the program? For me, it seems better to use c++ string</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Euchre cstring</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Using C-strings requires you to use pointers. Since Pointers are such an important and fundamental concept in computer science, we require you to practice learning how to use them in a variety of ways, including C-strings. BTW, there is always a C-string question on the midterm exams for this course.</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>So I understand that technically, under the hood, a C-string is a pointer that</p>

<p>by default is pointing to the first character in an array of chars,</p>

<p>but then if we wanted to access the other chars in this array of chars, we are able to traverse this array</p>

<p>Which we could do by adding 1, 2, 3, etc. (up to the length of this array) to the value of the C-string pointer</p>

<p>Because then we are just modifying the memory address that this C-string points to.</p>

<p>Hoping that these above points are correct, my question is then this:</p>

<p>If C-strings are technically, datatype-wise, pointers to an array of chars, are all arrays technically pointers that point to to little slices of memory holding some group of values that are "in a row?"</p>

<p>ex: There is an array of integers called numArr holding {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} . Is numArr the pointer datatype? Does it then point to the memory address holding the int 1 by default?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for clarifyng this point! (Not an intended pun, but…it works, ha!)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Are all arrays pointers, or is it just C-Strings that are pointers?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah it sounds like you have it. The name of the array is a pointer to the first element of the array regardless of it's type. The only thing that really differentiates a c-string from an array of char is that it has the special null character element at the end. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
yes all arrays are under the hood pointers. try declaring an array and dereferencing the name of the array, you should get the first element. 
also when you index into an array the compiler just sees that and does pointer arithmetic adding index number to the pointer to the beginning pointer to get you that specific element</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have the following code within main:</p>
<p> </p>
<pre>char *abc = "hello";<br />cout &lt;&lt; abc + 1 &lt;&lt; endl;<br /><br />int arr[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };<br />cout &lt;&lt; arr &lt;&lt; endl;<br />cout &lt;&lt; arr + 1 &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
<p> The first cout produces "ello" as output, while the second and third produce an address.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My question is, why does "ello" output for the first cout? Isn't abc just a pointer, and</p>
<pre>cout &lt;&lt; abc</pre>
<p>should output an address, just like how it did with the integer array?</p></TEXT>

Fun fact: The &lt;&lt; operator will automatically treat char* as a c string! Because who wants to write a loop every time you want to print a c-string?</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Sprint Midterm Problem 4 - replace function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
It *seems* like the size of the array is changing, but remember that built in arrays have fixed sizes. You can, however, move the contents around to give the illusion that the size has changed.</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Yes, that is allowed.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>To give this illusion can you just add NULL values for when the string gets smaller?</p>

<p>['h', 'a', 'm', '\0', '\0']? Is that allowed?</p></TEXT>

String literals in c++ ("spam" is a string literal) have the type const char*. When you try to assign a string literal to a char*, the compiler will say something along the lines of "deprecated conversion from const char* to char*.

<p>The first one certainly doesn't work because it uses single quotes which in c++ will give a compile error. 2 works bc you're enumerating the elements of the array. 3 does not because we haven't specified the array size and we are using a regular array instead of a char pointer. 4 works because under the hood the letters will be assigned into the individual spots of the array. This is a special case where you don't have to specify the array size. You can only do this with char/string arrays. Not ints or doubles and not arrays of ADTs</p></TEXT>

<p>I typed these in in a text file and compiled with a CAEN vnc compiler.  1 does not compile.  2, 3, and 4 do work.  1 does not work because it uses single quotes.  2 works because you are enumerating the characters being placed into the array.  You don't need the null character to make it compile.  Though if you simply print str2 you'll get funky results at the end.  But it compiles nonetheless.  3 and 4 both work because this is how C-strings implicitly work.  It doesn't matter than 4 is a pointer as far as compilability.  The pointer only changes what you can do with the string and how you do it.</p></TEXT>

<p>// REQUIRES: fruits points to an array of unique strings</p>
<p>// num_fruits is equal to the number of strings in fruits</p>
<p>// EFFECTS: Searches fruits for eat. If found, swaps found element in fruits</p>
<p>// with last element in fruits. Returns number of strings in fruits</p>
<p>// not including the found element. At most one match is possible.</p>


<p>After finding the correct element, are we supposed to set the last element equal to the found element AND CHOP OFF the last element? It doesn't say that, but otherwise I don't think the function makes a lot of sense..</p>


<p>Either way, if we have an array of strings and we want to remove one element (whether it is the last, first, etc), can we set that element equal to the null char ("\0")? Or is there a better way to do it?</p>


<p>Thanks</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Spring 2014 Question 2b</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you are suppose to swap the two elements so now the "eaten" fruit is at the very end of the array if it exists and we also decremement the value of num_fruits if we did find the fruit to eat. so the idea is we will use the value num_fruits to know how many times we need to loop through the array. So by decrementing the value we just end up not interacting with the elements past the num_fruits element</p>

<p>there are several ways of "deleting" elements in an array one is having a dummy value that represents that no real value exists there such as "\0" or you can do it by swapping to the end and adjusting the size. either way is valid depending on how you implement your functions that have to deal with the arrays.</p>

<p>I don't recommend using \0 as a empty value I would just use a string that has a meaning but couldn't be confused with something else personally "empty" sounds like a great string value to use to convey that element is empty as long as that makes sense in the context of what the array is being used for.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes that is correct, you are switching the orange with the last element in the array which is peach then you are decreasing the size of num_fruits so you only print out the first three things afterwards</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So for clarification, if my array of strings was ' apple orange banana peach ' and the variable eat was "orange" , than my new array of strings would be ' apple peach banana ' ??</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>is there suppose to be something written for print basket in midterm_sp2?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Same</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>hmmm...let me investigate</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's back up now (or should be, please let me know if you have any more problems - either here or at <a href="mailto:jjuett@umich.edu">jjuett@umich.edu</a>).</p>

<p>It's a recurring issue we've been having over the past week with Labster's host.  I don't know exactly how to (or if I'm even able to) fix it, so I'm generally at the mercy of whenever someone is able to get back to me about the problem.  One of three things happened just now - either I miraculously discovered the secret sequence of repeated commands and server restarts to fix it, someone from DCO fixed the problem but hasn't actually responded to my email, or it just randomly started working again.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>it seems to be down again</p></TEXT>

<p>Labster does not seem to be working right now. Does anyone else have this problem?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For accessing values that are within structs which are within another struct, which is passed by pointer:</p>
<p>1. </p>
<pre>Pricebook -&gt; quotes.price</pre>
<p>or </p>

<p>2. </p>
<pre>Pricebook -&gt; quotes -&gt; price</pre>

<p>Just to clarify, is the reason why the top one is correct, because (Pricebook -&gt; quotes) evaluates to a Quote instead of a pointer to Quote? And to access within a value, you use the . operator? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
struct inside of struct</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Would be quotes-&gt;price if quotes is a pointer, would be quotes.price otherwise.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So because quotes is an array you can't do the quotes.price you would need to index into the array so use quotes[index].price</p>

<p>for the second way because the name of an array is actually a pointer to the first element of an array so using quotes-&gt;price will get you the price of the Quote object in the first index</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>winter 2014 midterm last question I believe </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>could someone please tell me where this quotes/price example is so i can refer back to it?</p>

<p>Just wondering, does anyone have tips for studying for this midterm? So far, I'm thinking of doing the practice exam and looking at lecture exercises, labs, and past/current projects. Anything else we should be doing for this exam?</p>

Advice for Midterm Studying?</TEXT>

<p>I tried to identify any concepts I didn't fully understand and then I went on BlueReview and am currently re-watching those lectures. I've found this really helpful.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would take one of the exams blind without help and see which concepts you are still a little foggy on and what concepts you understand and can act on. Then go study the concepts you are still foggy on a bunch then take the other exam and see if you've improved on anything</p>

<p>Also if you haven't done all the option parts of the labs I highly recommend you try and complete those as extra examples of concepts </p></TEXT>

<p>cout &lt;&lt; *y;</p>
<p>y = x; </p>

<p>1. Since y is uninitialized and thus not pointing to a particular place in memory, when *y is printed, what prints: 13 or another, random integer?</p>

<p>1)</p>
<p>I would imagine that 13 is printed because even if y isn't declared it still points to some place in memory and we said that that location in memory is overwritten with the value 13 (note that you shouldn't be able to compile this function due to the compiler complaining about using uninitialized variables, also if you got around that it might cause a seg fault depending on where y randomly is pointing )</p>

<p>yes but it should be phrased as y is assigned the value x but that is just symantics</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This is a very specific question. Using lecture 9, slides 19-20 as an example: you have several instances of a struct in an array and these structs contain data. The data can be accessed how they are in the slides:</p>
<pre>triangles[0].a=3;<br />triangles[1].b=12;<br />triangles[2].c=17;</pre>
<p>It was also mentioned in the lecture that a,b, and c of each triangle are next to each other in memory. Therefore, would it be possible to access this data with code like:</p>
<pre>triangles[0][0]=3;<br />triangles[1][1]=12;<br />triangles[2][2]=17;</pre>
<p>In other words, would going off the array still be accessing significant data, in this case... or am I just oversimplifying how memory works?<br /><br />Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Question about Arrays of Structs</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm not really sure I understand the question but the proper way you should be accessing the member variables of structs in an array is the first way.</p>

<p>I'm fairly certain that if you tried to use the second way's syntax you would get a compiler error because you shouldn't be able to index into a triangle object and the compiler knows that</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The second one is wrong. An array is a set of same types next to each other in memory, in the case of triangles the set contains structs. Structs are not indexed, therefore you can't access them using index numbers.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>To what extent will the readings from the book be useful? If we do all the readings and understand all the material within them, will we probably be in good shape for the exam?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Importance of Readings</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>the test book is there to be an extra resource, it is a place to go if the given explanation in lectures and labs are not quite clear and just another source of the same information. I would study the practice exams and the lectures more than the text book. </p>

<p>also doing the the optional parts of the lab if you haven't done them yet is an excellent way of getting some extra practice with concepts and usually the option parts are a little more tricky than the rest of the lab.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>if you have already read the corresponding chapters in the text book and you have read all the lectures slides I'm not really sure what else you could read.</p>

<p>it's just that the practice exams and the trickier optional labs questions are a more accurate representation of what the exam will look like in terms of difficultly and what you will be expected to be able to code a solution to a problem.</p>

<p>In my personal opinion the best way to study any sort of computer science/programming class is to go out and actually code up examples and see what works and what doesn't work but more importantly why things work or don't work. Also we have posted all the exam write your own code questions in labster so you can write your solutions to the questions and actually be able to run through them line by line.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I am same as you. Though that's probably because I usually don't listen. :) Alex Allain's websites are an excellent resource if you want to do extra reading. For pointers, I have not read a better explanation than Stephen Kochan's Programming in C 3rd edition chapter 12 (for that matter, this book is a better introduction than any other C/C++ books I have seen). </p>

<p>Also, Jay is right, it's good to know why things work/not work and to put specific examples in your visual memory perhaps the best thing you could do is to actually code sample problems. However, there is an alternative to that (at least works for me) and that's to actually find a resource with lots of code samples and explanation of codes. Malik's Introduction to Programming in C++ is good for that, he has a ton of complete code examples that you can learn from. Hope this helps...</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Okay thanks for all the suggestions. Am I correct in understanding that, at the very least, the book will get me up to speed with what has been covered thus far in lecture, even if it isn't the best resource for the exam?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I personally tend to learn a lot better from reading than from listening. Are there any readings available that would adequately prepare me for the exam?</p></TEXT>

Spring midterm, question 4</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Problem 4 asks you to write the replace and insert functions. You can do this without using a temporary array, assuming the user who calls your function declared the cstrings as described in @1042. As you write the function, it's fair for you to assume that the user won't try to pass your function a const cstring, because the RME warns them that your function will modify the cstring that start, end, and str point to. </p>
<p>To see an example of how the user would declare the cstring and call your function, check out the code for this problem on Labster. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No. I believe that that line in the prompt is only referring to declaring new arrays of chats in your solution. Without declaring a pointer, traversal by pointer would be nigh impossible.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>On a related note, if a problem says that "you may not declare any temporary arrays of c-strings and you must use traversal by pointer," does this mean that I am not allowed to make a new char* pointer to use as a loop variable? In other words, would I have to find a way to implement traversal-by-pointer using the pointers from the arguments?</p></TEXT>

<p>I was just curious if this exam would be completely short answer as it looks on the practice exams? Also, are there no solutions to the practice exams?</p></TEXT>

Exam Format</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>the format of the exam will be exactly like the old practice exams we gave you, so there will be some short answer questions and then some questions where you will need to write code.</p>

<p>As for the solutions we historically don't post the solutions to the exams  so if you are feeling unsure of your answer make a piazza post or meet up with a group of other 280 students and you can compare answers and try to defend yours if they differ by explaining your logic/thought process</p></TEXT>

<p>why was the value of *d changed to 6, and not *c? I am confused because I read it as change the value of where c is currently pointing to (a[2]) to the value of where d is currently pointing to (b[2]) plus one. </p>
<p>so c* = *d + 1. But instead, *d incremented an d*c was unaffected?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
post-decrement example from lecture</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>We start with c pointing to the beginning of a and d pointing to the beginning of b. The line</p>
<p>*c++ = *d++ says "Set the thing c points to equal to the thing d points to, then increment c and d." So at the end of that step, a[0] = 4 (because that's what d was pointing to), c points to a[1], and d points to b[1]. Then we get to *c = (*d)++. That says "Set the thing that c points to to the thing that d points to, then increment the thing that d points to." So we set a[1] (that c points to) to 5, because at that time, b[1] (which d is pointing to) is 5. Then we increment the thing that d is pointing to, so b[1] = 5+1 = 6.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You are mostly correct. That line does make whatever *c is pointing to equal to whatever *d is pointing to, which is why the second element in a is changed to a 5. That line also does a second thing. Because there are parentheses around the *d, and parentheses "bind" stronger than incremenst, and deferments for that matter, when the post increment is enacted, it is evaluated on the entire dereference of the pointer d. Which is why it increments the 5 in to a 6.</p></TEXT>

<p>My question is about failed input streams. In the scenario presented in this slide, would the stream eventually enter a failed state? I'm getting a bit confused…would foo  just hold the value 42 and then the stream would enter a failed state and the qwerty\n would still say in the buffer? or would it not enter a failed state because the variable foo was able to read in the 42 and then it would just stop?</p>


<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Exam 1 Failed Stream Question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As the slide says, the attempted conversion succeeds until it gets to the q, and the stream is left with "qwerty\n" in it. So it doesn't fail, and what's left in the stream will sit there until you ask for the stream contents.</p>

<p>Let's look at what that means with some sample code:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;<br />using namespace std;<br /><br />int main() {<br />  cout &lt;&lt; "Type some junk." &lt;&lt; endl;<br />  int foo;<br />  cin &gt;&gt; foo;<br />  cout &lt;&lt; "Foo is " &lt;&lt; foo &lt;&lt; endl;<br />  string word;<br />  while (cin &gt;&gt; word) {<br />    cout &lt;&lt; "Word is " &lt;&lt; word &lt;&lt; endl;<br />  }<br />}<br /><br /></pre>

<p>If I give it input that I know will put it into a failed state, we never print "Word is," because the failed state makes cin &gt;&gt; word evaluate as false.</p>
<pre>-bash-4.1$ ./a.out
Type some junk.
qwerty
Foo is 0
</pre>

<p>But if we give it the input from your question, it just takes the 42 and sticks that in foo, says "This qwerty thing isn't part of my number, so I'm not going to use it when I set foo," and then moves on to the while loop. It's still got stuff in the cin stream, so it goes ahead and executes the body of the while loop. When it gets back up to evaluating the condition for while, it just waits around for me to give it more input; when I give it "Go Blue!" it keeps executing the while loop.</p>
<pre>-bash-4.1$ ./a.out
Type some junk.
42qwerty
Foo is 42
Word is qwerty
Go Blue!
Word is Go
Word is Blue!
</pre>

int main(){
int a[2] = [2,4,3];
int *b = a;
helper1(a,b);

Pointers and Scope</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Also, in my project, for the Pack_deal_one function, I did:
Card Pack_deal_one(Pack *pack_ptr){
pack_ptr-&gt;next++;
}
This just shows the pointer incremented, but wouldn't this not work because once the function terminates, the pointer points back to the original next?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Your array a doesn't have a third element. I'm going to assume you meant to initialize a as</p>
<p>int a[3] = {2,4,3};</p>

<p>So you pass a and b into helper1. helper1 now has its own copy of the pointer b. It points to the same thing as the pointer b from main, but it's a copy. Let's call it helper-b to be clear about it. When you say b = (a+1), you set helper-b to point to a[1]. Then you say *b = 3, which says "Set the thing helper-b is pointing to to be 3." So a[1] is now 3. Then you increment helper-b, so it's pointing to a[3]. But then you return, and helper-b disappears. You're left with regular old b, which was not modified and still points to the beginning of a.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The -&gt; operator is the same as (*pack_ptr).next. You're still doing the dereference and so you're still changing the appropriate value since pack_ptr was passed by pointer as a parameter of the function</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Ok if that is true, then why does my pack_ptr-&gt;next++ work?  Once the Pack_deal_one function terminates, wouldn't pack_ptr be pointing to the original next?</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>How is it more tedious for a struct?</p>
<p>Whether you have to type the label <tt>public:</tt> for a class or <tt>private:</tt> for a struct, there really is no more tedium involved in one versus the other.</p>
<p>The only thing being that a class has the name "class", following the typical name for an object in OOP, where a struct might be said to imply certain things as a carry-over from C++'s C origins.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>in good c++ style code we want to use as much stuff from c++ as we can because c code can look gross sometimes, if you wanted to use all the c style stuff you should just write in c not c++</p>

<p>I am confused about how/when to use dependency graphs, is this a topic we should know for the exam? or was it just to help us think through the problem given in lecture?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Do we have to know about dependency graphs?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Any topic covered in lecture is fair game for the exam. Dependency graphs are a tool for thinking through the type of problem you saw in lecture, where you need to figure out the order in which to update variables. You draw the dependency graph to understand which variables depend on which other variables. If a variable doesn't have any edges leading in to it, you can safely update that variable, then remove it and the edges pointing out of it from the graph. Once you've updated all of the variables and have an empty graph, you've got your ordering.</p>
<p>Dependency graphs also tell you when this won't work. If there's a cycle in your dependency graph, that means two variables depend on each other, so neither one of them is safe to update first. You can solve this problem using temporary variables.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So I can traverse the code and I understand all of it, but I am having a hard time understand how in the sausage function, </p>

<p>the 3rd line (ptr++) results in the pointer not incrementing at all.  Shouldn't it point to spam[2] instead of spam[1]?</p></TEXT>

<p>ptr++ does indeed increment the pointer, but at the end of the function call this goes away because pointers are passed by value into the function. We changed what the pointer points to, but we do not change where it points after the stack frame for sausage is destroyed.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Your thinking behind this is correct, but your wording is a little off. Put it this way, pointers are by default passed by value, but (assuming they aren't declared const) they allow you to change the thing they're pointing to.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
So the value at the pointer is technically pass by reference while the pointer itself is pass by value?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I would like to request a sanity check for my understanding of addresses and pointers.</p>

<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>int num = 3;</p>
<p>int *ptr = &amp;num;</p>

<p>cout &lt;&lt; ptr &lt;&lt; endl;     <strong>\\ Does this return the address of num?</strong></p>
<p>cout &lt;&lt; *ptr &lt;&lt; endl;    <strong>\\ Does this return 3?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>

<p>Thank you!</p></TEXT>

Questions regarding Addresses and Pointers</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm going to read through your code in English, and correct me if anyone else thinks I'm wrong...</p>

<p>Set num equal to the integer 3.</p>
<p>Ptr is a pointer to an int (called num), so it gets the address of num.</p>

<p>Printing out ptr will give you the ADDRESS it points to.</p>
<p>Printing out *ptr will give to the THING it is pointing to, in this case: 3.</p>

<p>So yes it looks correct to me! I would recommend playing around with * and &amp; in a simple program.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm looking through my notes and have written the scope resolution operation is needed in triangle.cpp "so the compiler knows it is a member function inside Triangle."</p>

<p>My question is why? If we have included "triangle.h" which has all of the prototypes, why do we need to tell the compiler this?</p>

<p>Is it because Triangle is a class and contains not just some normal functions?</p>

Scope Resolution Operator Question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>

<p>Thanks, good luck on your studying adventures.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Scope Resolution Operator Question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Since the implementation and declaration of the Triangle class are separate, the scope resolution operator is necessary to differentiate between the class' actual member functions and other stuff (like normal functions, as you said). Reasons this is important: class member functions have access to the private data members of that class, this disambiguates functions with potentially the same name/type signature, etc. So yes, you're right. Including the Triangle.h file in Triangle.cpp links the two together, but if you want to define a member function of a class separately from its declaration you must include the scope resolution operator.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have it in my notes that the following code:</p>

<p>int f(const int* x) {<br />      int* y = x;<br />      *y = *y + 1;<br />      return *y;<br /> }<br /> int main() {<br />      int x;<br />      x = f(&amp;x);<br /> }</p>

<p>returns a compiler error, whereas the following code: </p>

<p>int f(const int* x, int* y) {<br />      *y = *y + 1;<br />      return *y;<br /> }<br /> <br /> int main() {<br />      int x;<br />      x - f(&amp;x, &amp;x);<br /> } </p>

<p>does not return an error. Does anyone know why this is?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
question on consts and pointers</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In your first example, the function f takes a parameter x of a pointer-to-const-int, meaning that the pointer x cannot change the integer to which it points. Then in the first line of the function, the pointer y is a pointer-to-int, but not a pointer-to-const-int - meaning that y may modify the integer to which it points. So initializing the value of y to the value of x is a compiler error because this would be allowing y to access (and potentially modify) the const object to which x points.</p>

<p>In your second example, int* y is just a regular pointer-to-int, so it can modify the int value to which it points. The other parameter, x, is a pointer-to-const-int, but it's never used in the function. If, in the second function, you tried to do something like:</p>
<pre>*x = *x + 1; //or<br />y = x;</pre>
<p>You'd have a compiler error because in both cases you're potentially modifying the const value to which x points.</p>

<p>Hopefully this makes sense!</p></TEXT>

<p>Well, p is a pointer and q is an array, so it's both of the following declarations are equivalent:</p>


<p>First: Quote *q = p-&gt;quotes</p>

<p>Second: Quote *q = &amp;(p-&gt;quotes[0])</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well, p is a pointer and q is an array, so it's both of the following declarations are equivalent:</p>


<p>First: Quote *q = p-&gt;quotes</p>

<p>Second: Quotes *q = &amp;(p-&gt;quotes[0])</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In both instances, Quote *p will point to the first element of the quotes array. There is no copying being done in either case, only pointing.</p>

<p>p-&gt;quotes fetches the memory address of the first element of the quotes array.</p>
<p>&amp;(p-&gt;quotes[0]) fetches the memory address of the first element of the quotes array.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>taha is correct we aren't copying the array we are simply telling the program that q now knows where the array starts. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
But if you say the name of the array, that implies its the first element of the array, not the entire array.  Also, I don't think you can explicitly copy all the elements of one array into another array.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
p-&gt;quotes is not a constant quote, it is the memory address of a constant quote.  Constant pointers and Constant objects being pointed to are two separate entities.  I think it is fine.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
p-&gt;quotes is different from p-&gt;quotes[i].  p-&gt;quotes[i] is a quote, not p-&gt;quotes</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Does inheritance play a role in casting the counting pointer (*q) as const/ nonconst.</p>
<p>Basically, since *p is a pointer to a constant Pricebook, should it be:</p>
<p>const Quote *q = p-&gt;quotes  ?</p>

<p>Does the quotes object inherit the const casting from *p?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I know we can't use global variables, but can we have static variables? For example I want to declare a static int hand_count that I can call in multiple functions within my Game.cpp file, is this allowed?</p></TEXT>

Static variables</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Don't think so: in the "Do's and Don'ts" table in the project spec, global/static variables is listed as a "Don't." </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>i have seen the previous discussion on this problem. I am now still confused. I tried the code</p>
<p>*(end-1)= new_char;<br />  i donot know what to do after. I donot know how to "delete" those previous characters before *(end-1). I get the answers like "sham" rather than"ham".</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
spring mid-term problem 4</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>One approach is to overwrite the earlier characters with the later characters. Rather than setting the character right before end to be new_char, set start* to new_char, then shift the characters from end onwards over to meet it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
After you copy new_char to start, you have "hpam/0". You want "ham/0". So you need to copy the a to the spot where the p is, then copy the m to where the (original) a is, and so on. </TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That is exactly what I do at the start. However, there are two problems here. FIrst, the length of arbirary string start is not given. How can  we do pointer traversal without a given length? using strlen()?</p>
<p>Second , for the last character '/0', there is a complie error if we directly assign something like str[5] = "/0" or *(str+5)="/0"</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>because this is a c string you can just loop until you hit the '\0' character so you don't need to know the size of the c string.</p>
<p>my favourite way of doing this is</p>


<p>while(*ptr)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>  //do stuff with the  c string</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>once the ptr gets to the null character it's logically equivalent to false so you break out of the loop</p>

<p>and I think your compiler error is from trying to use double quotes "\0" instead of single quotes '\0' for assigning the value. remember that double quotes are for declaring a string and single quotes are for declaring a char and c strings are an array of chars so you can't put a string in one of the elements</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks for your help!This question is super tricky!</p>
<p>The final answer is </p>
<p>*start=new_char;<br />  while(*(end-1)){<br />   <br />  <br />    *(++start) = *(end++);<br />    <br />   }<br />  *start= '\0' ;<br />}</p>
<p> </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What are the differences between *(++ptr) and *(ptr++)? (And anything similar I suppose. I remember going over this in lecture but can't seem to remember)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>there are like at least 6 posts about this so try searching for ++ or something like that</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Can you explain more explicitly? i dnot know how to deal with that after the  *start = new_char. It does not change anything.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>that is why you need to understand the concepts and the syntax of everything so you can make sure what you're writing is correct </p></TEXT>

<p>because the name of an array is a pointer you can either dereference it or just index using the name</p>

<p>here's a secret when you say fruits[2] the compiler really just converts this to pointer arithmetic and essentially does *(fruits +2). but personally I use indexing whenever possible because it's just easier to think about and I don't accidentally a pointer</p></TEXT>

<p>So in the first one, when you call strcpy, I think you're violating a requirement of strcpy: according to the C++ ref page, the size of the array pointed to by destination (hi) must be large enough to contain the C string pointed to by source (hello). You never actually set the value of hi to anything in the first example before you called strcpy. See this page for more on strcpy:</p>

<p>http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strcpy/</p>

<p>In the second one, you set hi to point to the same thing as hello (the first character in "hello"), so strcmp returns 0.</p></TEXT>

<p>If you have to write a tail-recursive function and you use a helper function, does the helper function also have to be tail recursive?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Tail Recursion Question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Remember: tail-recursive means that the memory stack of one function can be deleted when that instance of the function completes since no computations need to be performed anymore in that function. For any function to be tail-recursive, its helper function should also follow the conditions of what it means to be tail-recursive. This saves MUCH memory in real-world application.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Also, look at your tail recursive functions and the helper functions, and notice where the recursion is actually happening. It's the helper function calling itself, right? So make sure that the part of your code that's actually recursive--the helper function--is tail recursive.</p></TEXT>

<p>The compiler automatically does pointer arithmetic conversion; it does the arithmetic with memory addresses, then divides the answer by the size of the type/object.</p>

<p>In our example, the compiler would automatically do:   ((memory address of where p points to) - (memory address of eggs) )/(the size of memory that an egg takes up)</p>

<p>The first iteration: 'temp' will point to the same memory address as 'real', which is 0x00, so the compiler will do the following arithmetic: (0x0 - 0x0)/4 = 0/4 = 0</p>
<p>The second iteration: 'temp' will point to the memory address of the second position in 'real', which is 0x04, so the compiler will do the following arithmetic: (0x4 - 0x0)/4 = 4/4 = 1</p>

<p>The compiler automatically does pointer arithmetic conversion; it does the arithmetic with memory addresses, then divides the answer by the size of the type/object.</p>

<p>In our example, the compiler would automatically do:   ((memory address of where p points to) - (memory address of eggs) )/(the size of memory that an egg takes up)</p>

<p>That is why we get: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>int *eggs is a pointer to an int, and int *p is a pointer to an int.</p>
<p>When you do arithmetic with pointers to ints, you can think of the result as using "int" as its unit. If p = eggs + 1, then p is one int past eggs. If we calculate p - eggs, the difference is one int.</p></TEXT>

<p>When passing arguments to a main function, how is argc defined? Is it implicit based on how many arguments there are, or does it have to be explicitly stated by the user?</p></TEXT>

<p>I just have a few questions regarding c strings and their representations as arrays. </p>

<p>for example for the c-string  char x[] = "hello";</p>

<p>the length of the string would be 5, but the size of the array that contains it would be 6 correct?</p>

<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
c strings</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes. the string length is 5, but there needs to be 6 slots of memory reserved to make this string.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes you can do char* x = "hello";</p>
<p>char* x = "hello"</p>
<p>char x[ &gt;= 6] = "hello"</p>
<p>char x[] = "hello"</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
you can do char *x = "hello";
I think it is better to do:
const char * x = "hello";</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No actually. For some reason if you declare a string literal by pointer you NEED const.</p>

<p>It isn't just better to make it const char *x = "hello, you are REQUIRED to do it that way otherwise you will get a compiler error (at least on linux).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so all the above ways are ways to declare a c-string..however doing something like char[5] = "hello"; would no longer make it a c-string?</p>

<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Idk if that's gonna compile actually, but you will know if you try.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Plus char[]={ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' } is another way to do it. If you want the cstring to be modifiable you must declare it as an array, not as a pointer.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>i dont think char[5] = "hello" is viable, because the size is actually 6, plus one for '\0'.</p>
<p>you can do " char* x  = "hello" ", on Visual Studio its perfectly fine.</p>
<p>pointer can always be changed but the memory that it points to becomes different.</p>
<p>also, you cannot change x "char x[] = "hello" " later because array is not a modifiable l-value(basically it can't be changed)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
On linux if you do char* x = "hello" you get a warning, assuming you compiled with the -Wall -Werror .... flags.  
Although it is technically ok to do char *  x = "hello", you should just do const char * x = "hello".</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so if we were to make this string manually would we do something like </p>
<p>const int size = 6;</p>
<p>char x[size] = "hello";</p>

<p>how would we make it manually so that it is still a c-string?</p>

<p>or could we do char *x = "hello"; ?</p></TEXT>

<p>The variable i is a pointer-to-int; its actual value when initialized in the for loop is an address (the address of the first integer of array). So i &lt; size is not a valid comparison because of type differences: i is a pointer containing an address, whereas size is just an int. On the other hand, i &lt; (array + size) is a valid comparison because array + size is a pointer to five spots in memory down from where the first integer of array is stored.</p>

<p>Try running the above code and replacing (i &lt; array + size) with (i &lt; size); you should get a compiler error. In XCode, I get the error "Comparison between pointer and integer."</p></TEXT>

<p>If you are studying the patterns for traversal we've seen in the class, I think Labster is pretty helpful. You can go to eecs280labster.eecs.uimch.edu (as long as it's not randomly down again) and check out the "traversal" example. In particular, take note of the difference in what's on the stack frames in traversal-by-index and traversal-by-pointer.  In the former, you see in memory we're keeping track of an integer index that increases through all the indices in the array.  In the latter, it's a pointer (i.e. address) that moves along the array through every address.</p></TEXT>

<p>I think this is a pretty common concern among students.  If anyone has tips, post them in the follow-ups below.  For the code writing questions, practice pays off - a lot of the conceivable questions one could come up with reuse the same concepts and patterns.  For example, practicing will ensure you have mastered the code for traversing arrays (either by index or pointer), for expressing a recursive case using operations on lists and trees, iterating through the characters in a cstring until you hit the '\0' sentinel. These general patterns are sure to show up somewhere.</p></TEXT>

<p>good test taking strategies are hard to learn but very valuable so I recommend trying to develop these, and I believe the university offers workshops on these strategies somewhere.</p>

<p>Also you can try to go through as many examples as possible between now and the test so you can equate a problem to an example you have already seen so you kind of know the structure your answer should be. Just be careful that the example you are basing your answer on is actually applicable to the question</p></TEXT>

<p>A helpful way to find out how the different pre- and post-increment/decrement operators work is to try them out in your IDE and see what happens. For example, I did:</p>

<p>I first get ptr = 0x7fff690548cc, then y = 5, then ptr = 0x7fff690548c8 because ptr has been decremented after assigning the value to which it points to y.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I disagree about *p--, Tara.</p>

<p>I believe that is the same as *(p--) because you decrement first because it binds more. Decrement the pointer then get what it's pointing to.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Or is this a difference between prefix and postfix increments...</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yep, there are some subtle and tricky differences between the two. If we had *--p, we would first decrement the pointer p and then get the value to which it points; that's prefix for you. However, postfix is a little different: *p-- actually evaluates *p first, then decrements the pointer itself. You're right that the increment/decrement operators bind tighter; however, because it's postfix *p comes first, then the decrement "binds" to the pointer p.</p></TEXT>

Tips for tree functions?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sometimes an easy way to organize tree functions is to start with the base case, then do a recursive call for the left subtree, then do a recursive call for the right subtree, and then make a tree with the recursively created left and right subtrees which you then return.  Your line should work in the same way, though it might be cleaner to split it up into multiple recursive calls.</p>

<p>If you aren't sure about how a function is working, try drawing stack frames!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Okay, so you would make the tree as you are calling it on the subtrees.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>

Winter 2014 Question 5a Stocks &amp; Structs</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
I am confused on how you can answer this problem.  
Quote max_after_purchase(const Pricebook *p, unsigned int t){
Because p is a pointer to a constant pricebook, all the quotes in pricebook are const.  So if you try to access like this:
Quote *max = 0;
for(int i = 0;  i &lt; p-&gt;size; i++){
   if(p-&gt;quotes[i].time &gt; t &amp;&amp; !max){
	  max = &amp;(p-&gt;quotes[i]);
    }
This is wrong because you are assigning a non const as a const.  However, we have  to make max non-const because it needs to be able to hold all possible quote values.  This problem doesn't seem answerable based on the fact that: const Pricebook *p.
Was the const a typo?</TEXT>

<p>For question 1fii). Would the answers be A, B, D ,E ? I'm confused about whether E would be one of the correct answers because technically it does fit the RME definition ( 0 is indeed a non-negative number) however using this 0 in the function results in a set-fault error? Are we supposed to disregard the error and just look at whether the 0 matches up with the RME?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Winter 2014 Midterm 1 fii)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The answers would be A and C. The reason why is because we know that if we run foo(3) it should return the value 6. For B, f we call foo(5) it should return a value of 15 (5 + (5-1) + (5-2) + (5-3) + (5-4) .... + 0 = 15)) so B is incorrect since it doesn't give us the right output according to the RMEs. For C, we are told by the RME that negative numbers are not allowed, so if we call foo on a negative number it should do something weird like a seg fault. For D, foo(4) is not 24, it's much smaller, so this is wrong. and E, our function foo should work for 0 because it's non negative, so if we do foo(0) it should not result in a seg fault so this answer is incorrect.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That makes so much sense, okay thanks!</p></TEXT>

<p>Is fruits a pointer to an array of pointers (each of which point to strings), or is fruits a pointer to an array of strings? In other words, if I have fruits[i], does that give me a string or a pointer to a string?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Spring 2014 2a</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Fruits is a pointer to an array of strings. By using the square brackets, you are essentially indexing the array with your pointer starting at the first element of this array of strings. fruits[i] is equivalent to *(fruits+i), which basically moves the pointer forward into the array i spaces and then dereferences it, accessing the value at that index of the array. This is done without actually moving the pointer so after accessing this element via this method, your fruits pointer is left still pointing at the first element of the string array.</p></TEXT>

This doesn't make sense to me, because in this case, "a" is a pointer to only the first element of the string..</p>
<p>is this a legit thing to do because a points in the string and knows everything else that resides past it? In my mind, you would be calling find_key with just one character and it would fail..</p></TEXT>

<p>i wasn't the one that posted, but what it asks you to do was make a swap. so if you find eat in the 2nd spot, swap it with what was in the very last spot of the array. you decrease num_fruit to make it seem like you got rid of the fruit that you ate. the fruit that you ate will remain somewhere in memory but you would have no access to it.</p>

<p>so yeah this is kinda like how they tell you when you delete something you may not have actually erased it. it just gets put somewhere in memory where you have no access to. like remember how you may have at some point been told that you have to assume whatever you post on facebook may be there forever? that's the idea. when you delete a post, you didn't actually delete it. it would just be stored somewhere that you have no access to and it may still be recoverable by officials.</p></TEXT>

Winter 3</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The first time you call find_key you will get a pointer to "&lt;" which is the beginning of a c-string (call it a). You call find_key again to get "&gt;" which will go from a until you get to that character (a pointer called b). Now you have the boundaries of the C string you want, and you can use a loop to print out the characters inbetween a and b inclusive.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's a pointer to the character, but since the string is an array of characters you know the next character will be next door to it. So you can get the pointer to "&lt;"  from find_key on "&lt;img" and a pointer to "&gt;" from find key on "&gt;". Now you have the beginning and the end of the img tag.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It will point to the "&lt;" character itself, but if you made the thing to find more than just "&lt;" then you will be able to increment the pointer and get the stuff you want.</p></TEXT>

<p>My code is currently looping through fruits until it finds a match with eat. When it finds the match, it replaces wherever it found the match with the last element and then I return the decrement of num_fruits. I am seeming to suspect that my syntax is wrong (*i = *(fruits + num_fruits);) which replaces wherever it found the match with the last element. </p>

<p>int eat_fruit(string* fruits, int num_fruits, string eat){<br />    for (string *i = fruits; i &lt; fruits + num_fruits; i++){<br />        if (*i == eat){<br />            *i = *(fruits + num_fruits); <br />            return num_fruits--;  <br />        }<br />        else{<br />            return num_fruits; <br />        }<br />    }<br />    <br />}</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>I'm not sure if it does…I think it might actually not ….i would guess it goes at the very end if it does print</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For this one, remember that the order of post-order traversal is 1) go left 2) go right 3) action (print the tree element). So if your tree has a left subtree, a right subtree, and a topmost element, the very last thing printed will be the topmost element of that tree. In this case the topmost element of the tree is 4, so yes 4 would be the last integer printed.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For the post order, I got 1 3 2 4 5 7 6</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>4 is the very last digit printed, because it is the last sequence of the first call.1 3 2 5 7 6 4</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>^^ I agree with 1 3 2 5 7 6 4</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>why doesn't the four print?</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>For problem 4 on Spring Midterm Exam, function insert:<br />Vidal did this problem by taking every char starting at spot and moving it strlen(to_insert) spots down. This works as long as the length of to-insert plus the point that spot is pointing to is already empty. Can this be assumed? If not, what if the string was "spamming" and to-insert was AAA and the spot was "a" in spamming? Then he would start moving "a" down 3 spots and it would replace the "i" in spamming which would never be able to be seen again and thus could not be copied later on.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Spring 4 Insert</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My logic was yes move the existing letters first, but start at the end and work your way towards spot.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I'm understanding your questions correctly, but it's safe to assume that str is long enough to accommodate for the extra characters in to_insert (last sentence of the REQUIRES: clause).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My logic was yes move the existing letters first, but start at the end and work your way towards spot.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>strlen will come in handy. After that, if you draw out the array yourself you can figure out your for loop conditions. You will be decrementing instead of incrementing.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I know I would use strlen to find my starting spot, but how would I find the ending point?</p>
<p>Could I do a for loop and use an if statement inside of it such as:<br />For (char *i = str[strlen-1]; i &gt; str[0]; --i)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>   if (i == spot)</p>
<p>   {</p>
<p>     return;</p>
<p>   }</p>
<p> //Contents of while loop</p>
<p>}</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so i used strlen twice...once to find the length of str and another time to find the length of to_insert</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I know its long enough for the extra characters.</p>
<p>As to the first person who answered: How do you do something like that? I'm not sure how to traverse by pointer and end at a specific spot in a c-string.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>

<p>Is this okay to do for c_strings? Labster is saying that key1 and key2 can't be made but I thought thats how we learned how to make c_strings in lecture... I'm really confused because in the question they use "&lt;p&gt;" as a parameter but labster won't let me. </p>


<p>const char* key1 = "&lt;img"; <br /> const char* key2 = "&lt;/p&gt;";<br /> const char* start = find_key(doc, key1);<br /> const char* end = find_key(doc, key2);</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Winter 2014 3</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes this is fine, but careful where you are ending. You don't want the entire string up to that point, only up to the "&gt;" after the "&lt;img"</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>that would compile, but the most important thing is how you use it, not if you write that line.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I know how to use it I'm just really confused on how to create c-strings. Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>what you did should work. in addition, you have a few other options:</p>

<p>const char *str="literal";</p>
<p>char str[]={ 's', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g', '\0' }</p>
<p>char str[]="literal";</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>And you don't need array sizes?</p>

<p>so for Spring 1b) is the third and fourth both correct c-strings?</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your help!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>they aren't necessary. if you want to include array sizes just keep in mind that you need them to be 1 bigger than the string size to account for having the null character there.</p>

<p>and yes that is what i said</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>would doing</p>

<p>const char *start = find_key(doc, "&lt;img"); </p>

<p>be acceptable?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Why would we need to traverse by pointer in this problem? Wouldn't we just call find_key to find the character at the beginning and end of the image and then call print_str on those to print the entire string that they wanted?</p></TEXT>

spring mid_term 4b</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Problems that I see with your code are:</p>
<p>1) In your for loops, you are comparing an int to the result of strlen(), which seems to be an unsigned int, but this is a rather minor issue.</p>
<p>2) For clarity purposes, in your first for loop, if indeed you are attempting to increment the address that the pointer spot points to in the string with the RHS of that assignment, I would just place spot++ on a new line.</p>
<p>3) In the first for loop, it isn't enough to just copy the letters only strlen(to_insert) away. For example, if the given str to insert the to_insert string into is longer, you will end up copying over letters that are needed for later copying.</p>
<p>4) In the second for loop, you immediately increment the to_insert pointer, losing the first letter in to_insert to copy into the original string. So instead of placing "AAA" into the string, you place "AA".</p></TEXT>

<p>For constructors in classes, do we explicitly have to make some kind of  constructor? or does it automatically make one for us if none is made?</p>

constructors Quesitons</TEXT>

<p>You have to create all of the constructors in a class you want implemented explicitly. And I believe you are correct on the differences between default and other constructors.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It seems like you don't have to technically. It's very dangerous not to because then forgetting to explicitly define what you member variables are later in your code could be using data somewhere in memory-land that you don't, or really shouldn't, be messing with. But it looks like the compiler won't really yell at you for not creating one. I also found that some compilers will create a default constructor for you, but we really can't always bet on that.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>An enum type associates categories with ints; for instance, behind the scenes</p>
<p>enum Semester {WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL};</p>
<p>uses 0 for WINTER, 1 for SPRING, 2 for SUMMER, and 3 for FALL.  So when you want to translate between strings and enums, you use an array of strings that has "Winter" at index 0, "Spring" at index 1, "Summer" at index 2, and "Fall" at index 3. </p>
<p>Now suppose you want to translate the string "Spring" to an enum. You iterate through your array, asking at each slot, "Does the string at this index match my input string?" At i=0, the answer is no, because "Summer" and "Spring" don't match. But at i=1, you find a match. Because of the way you've set up your array of strings, the index i that contains "Spring" corresponds to the int that means SPRING to the Semester enum. So you when you cast the int 1 to a Semester enum, it becomes SPRING, which is exactly the Semester you wanted.</p></TEXT>

<p>b = (a + 1);</p>

<p>(first line in the helper1 function)</p>
<p>I just want to double check the answers that I have for 1a)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Practice Exam W14 Question 1a</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The variable b is a pointer to an integer. The variable a, when passed into the function, is a pointer to the first element of an array of ints; remember that if a is an array, a == &amp;a[0]. In the first line, b is assigned the value of the address of the first element of a plus 1. So b should point to the second element of the array a.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, b++ increments the value of the pointer b to the next element of the array a. Be careful, though - remember that the pointer b inside the function is a copy of a pointer - the pointer passed in during the function call in main.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>correct. the only time b++ and ++b make a difference is if during that step you plan on doing something with the value or address</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>^^ good point. that pointer b is NOT the same as b in the main function</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So does this mean that the pointer b in int main() is still pointing to the first element of array a?  (Even though within the scope of the helper1 function, it's pointing at the third)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yep! Tricky question because the pointer names are the same, plus you have to remember that by default pointers are pass by value.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Okay thank you so much!!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes. the b of helper1 will be pointing to the 3rd element, but b of main will still be pointing to the 1st element.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So in the third line b++; it would essentially be doing the same thing, moving the arrow to the next element of a.  (Just making sure that the final answer arrow is pointing to the third element in the "a" array)</p></TEXT>

<p>Is foo(-1) a segfault error, or is it a different type of error? What exactly is the definition of a segfault error?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Winter 2014 1f.ii)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Briefly, a segmentation fault occurs when a program attempts to access memory that it's "not allowed" to access. I think this site's explanation is pretty good:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/debugging/segfaults.html">http://www.cprogramming.com/debugging/segfaults.html</a></p>

<p>And with regard to your other question, the function call foo(-1) has n = -1, so foo(-1) would return -1 + (-1 - 1) + (-1 - 2)...leading to infinite recursion. Note that one way to cause a segfault is when a recursive function uses up all the stack space. </p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
implications of pointers that are passed into functions being pass by value?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's important to remember that you can pass in an address or the value at that address (in regards to pointers), but these pointers when used in the function are actually clones of the originals and so a change made to them won't always be reflected in the formers.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So the <strong>pointer itself</strong> gets passed by value, and the <strong>thing that is pointed to</strong> gets passed by reference (also pointer).</p></TEXT>

<p>Yup and if you do one more thing you can print out the image tag</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm missing the final piece...do I update doc?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The reason you put c instead is because what you get for c is the pointer to "&lt;" and then you will have access to the rest of doc. If you just put doc you are looking for the first "&gt;" that pops up.</p>

<p>And yes you want to somehow update doc.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Should the print_str call then be as follows?</p>

<p>print_str(c, find_key(c, "&gt;");</p></TEXT>

<p>Not according to the C++ international standard: "A program that ... declares main to be inline, static, or constexpr is ill-formed." The standard requires that main have a return type of int.

<p>One of the problem need to swap the value of two elements in an array. </p>
<p>Is there are any way to make it with out using *(array) and *(array+1)?</p>

<p>I think the requirement means I can't put a variable in the bracket but I can use a specific number to replace i.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The wording on that exam was a bit unclear.  What we really care about is that you do "traversal by pointer" rather than "traversal by index".  So, if you don't have an integer index variable (i.e. for(int i = 0; i &lt; size; ++i) then you're fine.</p>

<p>T * const P;  ----&gt; I am a bit confused about using const here. IT says by placing the const here, the pointer cannot be changed.

<p>and then the const T *P means that the value of the place the pointer points to can't be changed, correct?</p>

<p>I think you've got it: const T *p means that the object to which p points is of constant type T, and therefore p (the pointer) is not allowed to modify that object. On the other hand, T *const p means the pointer may modify that which it points to, but the pointer itself cannot be modified, so we can't increment p or anything like that.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you have const T *const p, the pointer value cannot be changed, nor can the value of the object to which it points.</p></TEXT>

<p>so does the phrase -- or ++ binds tighter than * always apply?</p>

<p>if we have a pointer that is being incremented or decremented without a parenthesis, the increment(or decrement) will always happen to the <strong>address,</strong>correct? And if there is a increment (or decrement) operator used with a (*) then it means the increment(or decrement) will happen on the actual value of the thing the pointer points to ,correct?</p>

<p>so like (*d)++ would eventually actually increment the value of the thing d poitns to but </p>
<p>*d++ would just increment the address one "Thing" forward? </p>



<p>also if either of the above to examples are used alone on one line, does it matter whether the ++ ( or --) sign is to the left of or two the right of d?</p>

<p>how do you know which "binds tighter"?..so what will it do here? I was thinking that  in your example it will decrement the pointer by one address, and then give the value of what is located there? am i right? or will it decrement the VALUE of the thing that p poitns to?</p></TEXT>

<p>Given the outputs, you need to figure out the original tree the functions were acted on.</p>

<p>So pre-order starts by printing out tree_elt(tree). Looking at the output given, 90 is at the beginning so you know it must be the root of the tree. Then go left, and call the function again. It will print out the next root, 27. So you know your tree starts with 90, and has a left subtree starting with 27. They also give you post-order, so you can use these two functions together and construct the tree from which the output came. Also, recall the tree is balanced.</p>

<p>Hopefully that's enough to get you started! Some of it is trial and error I think.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>I just wanted to clarify a few things with pointers. Below is an example from lecture and I want to make sure I'm doing it right. </p>

<p>int a [ ] = {1, 2, 3};</p>
<p>int b [ ] = {4, 5, 8};</p>
<p>int *c = a;</p>
<p>int *d = b;</p>
<p>*c++ = *d++; // first command</p>
<p>*c = (*d)++; // second command</p>

<p>What are the final values of the arrays a and b?</p>

<p>In the first command:</p>
<ul><li><strong>*c</strong>++<strong> =</strong> <strong>*d</strong>++<strong> </strong>is executed first. The first element in d, which is 4, is now the first element in c. A.K.A, copied over. 
<ul><li>So now array "a" is {4, 2, 3} and array "b" is {4, 5, 8}. </li></ul>
</li><li>*c<strong>++ = </strong>*d<strong>++ </strong>is executed. Now, the index of c and d are both at the second element (i.e. a [ 1 ] and b [ 1 ]).
<ul><li>Array "a" is {4, 2, 3} and array "b" is {4, 5, 8}</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>In the second command:</p>
<ul><li> <strong>*c = (*d)</strong>++ is executed first. Now, the second element in d is now the second element in c. A.K.A, copied over. 
<ul><li>Array "a" is {4, 5, 3} and array "b" is {4, 5, 8}.</li></ul>
</li><li>*c = (*d)<strong>++ </strong>is executed. Now, the value at the second element in b is incremented by one (i.e. a [ 1 ] = 6).
<ul><li>So finally, array "a" is {4, 5, 3} and array "b" is {4, 6, 8}. </li></ul>
</li></ul>


<p>Someone please comment on whether my process is write or wrong. And/or what process I need to fix/understand. </p>
<p>Also, when I say "first element in d", I mean "d" that points to b. Just wanted to clarify that. </p>

<p>That's what I thought.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No. It would be a = {4, 5, 3} and b = {4, 6, 8}. This is because in the last line the post-increment is enacted on the thing which d points to, which happens to be the second element in b, changing the 5 into a 6.</p></TEXT>

<p>Ah ok, makes sense. Thanks.</p></TEXT>

<p>"</p>
<p>I believe it doesnt change to 6 because it is a post increment.... if you click the simulation on labster it will show you step by step of why it should be </p>
<p>a = {4, 5, 3} &amp; b = {4, 5, 8}</p></TEXT>

<p>You are right. My bad. That last post increment would be enacted on the pointer itself, meaning the value would be unchanged but d would be left pointing at the third element of b. Sorry</p></TEXT>

<p>So below is an image of on of the lecture slides from the Structs and Classes Lecture. This is at minute 37:00 in the Blue Review recording. I saw here that<br />&amp;w is passed into poke, and poke has the parameter (const X* z).<br />The way that I understood this is that<br />-  The parameter requires that z is a pointer to a constant X   (X being the struct that was previously declared), and that</p>

<p>-   w is an X, but not a const X.</p>

<p>-  &amp;w is the memory address of an X, but it is <em>not </em>the memory address of a const X .</p>

<p>My question is this: If &amp;w is <em>not </em>the memory address of a <em>const </em>X, then why is still allowed to be passed in for a pointer that points to a <em>const </em>X ??<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><img src="https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/hyrdt7uykox4mt/gx0gjpc96re3fh/i1a5ne8gbluh/Screen_Shot_20141015_at_12.03.03_AM.png" /></p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Passing in a memory address of a struct for a pointer to a const struct</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok it seems like you understand why we are able to pass the address of the struct X to z when z is looking for a pointer, so i'll skip directly to the explanation of the const. When dealing with const, remember that we can always go from less exclusive to more exclusive, just not the other way around. So when the address of w is given to z in the stack frame, that const just means that the function is promising not to change the value of w. That is, reading the declaration of z in the function signature, z is a pointer to an X that is const. So z is just accepting w as the thing it will be pointing at, with the added "promise" not to mess around with the "value" of X.</p>

<p>In this case, X is a struct so its "value" would be the data it contains.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Oh ok, I see. I did not know before this that it was acceptable to go from less exclusive to more exclusive. In that case if I had, for example, an int, and I also had a pointer to a constant int, would I then be allowed to assign the memory address of my int to the pointer?<br /><br />int n;</p>

<p>const int* ptr = &amp;n;</p>

<p>Would this then be c++ acceptable, because it goes from less exclusive to more exclusive?</p></TEXT>

<p>If I'm understanding your train of thought, I think the thing you're missing here is that pointers are pass by value not reference. This doesn't modified when you exit your function.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well yes, the pointers are passed by value, but you can still change the things that the pointers point to.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If pointers are passed by value, if you change what the pointer points to in a function, will that pointer be modified outside of the scope of that function?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If my understanding of all the material is correct, changing what a pointer points to in a function will not change what the pointer points to outside of the function. You can however change the value of the thing the pointer points to inside of the function and that value will also be changed on the outside. It's like pointers themselves are passed by value, but the things they point to are passed by reference.</p>

<p>That's my understanding, and it would be nice if a smart person could confirm or deny what I say.</p></TEXT>

<p>If asked to use traversal by pointer, is it illegal to use anything with the format *(ptr + i) for any reason, or would one be allowed to use such a statement outside the body of the loop which governed the traversal. For instance, for something like problem 2b in the spring midterm (assuming that problem specified that you were to use traversal by pointer), would it be legal to use a statement like *(fruits + num_fruits) = *i within the loop for (string* i = fruits; i &lt; fruits + num_fruits; i++)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Traversal by pointer</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I like to think that if they specifically ask us not to use *(ptr+i), we shouldn't use it. The spring exam only asks for traversal by pointer in problem 4, so I think using something like</p>
<p>*(spot+strlen(to_insert))) in the insert function is fine.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Can anybody explain all of the *(++ptr), *(ptr++), etc.?</p>

<p>What are the differences in the two above (and maybe more) similar statements?</p>
<p>I know roughly what they do, but what would be a very concise, clear explanation of what they do?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Pointers, symbols, etc. (*,++, --)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So the way I think about it is that there are two things going on. First we need to know if it is a pre or post increment/decrement. Second we need to know what that increment/decrement is being enacted on.</p>

<p>1)  So the difference between a post and pre is what the expression itself evaluates to.  In a pre,  the expression evaluates to the value with the added "+1" and with the post,  the expression evaluates to the value withough the added  "+1". So for instance, say you have a function named fn and and an int named i and you wanted to call you function with the parameter being i + 1. </p>
<p>         </p>
<p>           a). fn(i++).          b) fn(++i)</p>
<p>Here b would do what you wanted it to do but a in fact would call the function with just the value of i.</p>

<p>2) In regards to the dereference operator, what we like to say is that the increment/decrement  operators "bind tighter" than the dereference operator. So in any instance where both the dereference and the increment/decrement are right next to a pointer p, the increment/decrement will enact itself just the pointer.  Although if the dereference operator seperates the pointer and the increment/decrement, then the increments/decrement will enact on the object that the pointer points to. For example:</p>

<p>          c) *ptr++           d) *++ptr          e) (*ptr)++</p>

<p>Here in c the post increment would apply to the ptr, but it would move the pointer after the statement in which c is being used was evaluated. In d we have a similar situation except with a pre increment so the ptr will be moved prior to the statement evaluation. And in e we have that the post increment will enact itself into the object that the ptr points to after the statement has been evaluated, because parentheses are still god and "bind tighter" than anyone else.</p>

<p>I hope this helped.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No. In your case, the pre increment would be enacted on the "value" that ptr points to.</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks! I was wondering, could d also be written as ++*ptr or not? if this is a valid way to write it, would this way act the same as d above? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yup.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So basically as said above if the dereference operator separates the pointer and the increment/decrement then the "value" is acted upon and …otherwise if the increment/decrement operator and the dereference operator are adjacent to the pointer, then "++ or -- binds tighter" meaning the pointer is acted upon, correct?</p>

<p>i</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>(You can ignore the positioning of the ++ for this, just know that it increments each so there is then a follow up case if you were to loop through this)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Because of parentheses, this will increment both the place where end points and the place where start points prior to dereferencing them both and setting the value at wherever start now points to that of wherever end now points. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>To follow this up, if you had:</p>


<p> *(++start) = *(end++);</p>

<p>Does this change the value of the memory to which start points each and every time to the value of the memory to which end points?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
For the array a, I have two different responses
3 2 3 and 1 3 3
The former: Pointers are pass by value, thus any changes to where b is pointing to when passed through helper shouldn't reflect any changes to where it points to in main.
The latter: I simply follow the operations of helper when it's called.</TEXT>

<p>I think it's something wrong with labster. It doesn't seem to like the "&lt;img" part in the function inputs. It thinks it's not the right type or something. I'm pretty sure it is supposed to work though, so it's just something wrong with labster.</p></TEXT>

<p>Technically yes. Because you are comparing two addresses and end is clearly larger than start. (farther along the string)</p></TEXT>

<p>The approach I used was using two pointers that point at both the first and last elements in the array. Then you swap the values these pointers point to.

 <TEXT>
<p>your correct code should be</p>

<p>int *ptr = end(row)</p>

<p>the code you wrote would not work because dereferencing row gives you a char, not a c-string. </p>

<p>you also know how long the row is from the beginning, so there isn't really a need to use the end fxn.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
You can use the end function.
int *ptr = end(*row);
ptr points to the last element in the array.
I'm not sure if *row is an array though, it might just be the first element in the array.</TEXT>

<p>For your error, find key returns a pointer to a char. I don't believe you can compare it with the character '\0'.</p>

<p>The REQUIRES clause for find_key states that it will return flat out NULL if it can't find what thou are looking for in the c-string. So in that if statement, you could just place find_key(doc,key) which will evaluate to NULL when you want it to and NULL evaluates to false.</p>

 <TEXT>
W14 Problem 3</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>To call find_key again to find the end of the img tag, just use the pointer to the beginning of the img tag that you got from the first call as the first parameter in find_key and '&gt;' as the last one. By doing this, it searches from the beginning of the img tag onwards until it finds a '&gt;' and returns a pointer to that, since we are guaranteed not to find a '&gt;' until the img tag ends.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That's interesting! You've made the parse function recursive. That might work, but what is your base case? What if you run out of things to parse in the document or you don't find any image tags?</p></TEXT>

<p>It seems off because you can't do assignments like that. tree_left(tree) returns a copy of the left subtree, not a reference that you're trying to modify.You'd get an lvalue error because it would expect the assignment of tree_filter(tree_left(tree)) to be to a location, not another value.</p></TEXT>

<p>Reading through the instructions for 5a, it looks like we have to somehow access the time integer in the Quote struct using the Pricebook struct. I understand how doing something like p-&gt;quotes[i] can get you the quote at i, but how would you access information in that quote (time, price) through calling it with the Pricebook?</p>

<p>Yup, you can do that. You're dereferencing the pointer-to-Pricebook p and getting the element in its array of Quotes at index i; then since Quote itself is a struct, you're reaching into that struct and accessing its time data member.</p></TEXT>

<p>Just one thing. It looks like your first loop will take you to that spot where the quotes with times are no longer less than i. Your end result should come from looking at all of the quotes that are greater than t. Now I see that you made the starting position for j = i+1 which I am assuming is in order to accommodate for that, but a safer code would make the first while loop go until you are at a quote which is not less than or equal to t. Then you can start your next loop knowing that you are at the correct location. Beyond that, your code looks good to me.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi, GSIs and IAs. Got any tips for us youngsters regarding phone interviews? Thanks in advance</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Phone Interview Do's and Dont's</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I've had two for the first time ever and they can be quite intimidating. Just make sure to keep talking so there aren't any awkward silences and be sure to talk animatedly so they can hear your enthusiasm on the other end. Good luck!</p>

<p>One tip I've heard repeatedly is to smile while talking. It actually makes you sound better, even you though it sounds like it wouldn't.</p>

<p>Make sure you're in a peaceful location, without any extra sounds in the background nor with anything that may distract you.</p>
<p><br />Feel free to take out your resume, notes, questions for interviewer, and anything else that you would think would help you. Lay them out neatly and feel free to look them over as needed. No one will know you had them [nor does anyone care in a negative way], as long as you don't simply read off of them or take noticeable time to glance over them.</p>

<p>Try your best not to interrupt the interviewer. If you're like me, you may miss visual clues of when someone is expecting a reply or leaving an opening for a reply, and simply taking a second to pause before speaking again. If you <strong>do</strong> interrupt them, apologize appropriately and let them continue without letting it become awkward.</p></TEXT>

<p>definitely when you are thinking about a problem or writing out a possible solution think out loud and talk through each step you write. </p>
<p>just like the exam even if you don't get the correct answer showing your logic and thought process can get you far!</p>

that doesn't sound like a problem for a class, maybe you want to use an enum which sounds like a much better solution to your problem.

<p>For testing, I am trying to write my own test cases by initializing players and then adding cards to their hand so I can lead_card and play_card and such. But I'm having trouble initializing these variables because I try to do it like it is done in the tests cases written for us but these are not pointers, so I cannot pass them into the functions. So then when I try to make them pointers, when I say for instance</p>
<p>Player *john;</p>
<p>Player_init(john, "John");</p>

So as I was looking over my code from before checkpoint 3, I realized that I probably should not be using Card_get_suit() in Player_make_trump() because trump has not been made yet.

So lets say the number of points required for one team to win the game is 20.  
We go through 5 rounds and one team has gotten all 5 tricks, so they get 2 points.  Are we supposed to reset the pack and re-shuffle it?  If we do this, we will get the same results?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
point accumulations</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>To clarify, the game starts (game initialized, pack shuffled, then cards dealt).  Then, the team that calls suit gets five tricks, getting them 2 points.  The pack is then reshuffled, and the players will receive different cards.  I think where you're getting confused is you need to make sure the pointer points to the first card (as you programmed for the checkpoint), but the pack itself should not be reset to its original position.  (you should only get the same results every hand if you turn shuffle off)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No.  If your implementation of pack_deal_one involves removing the card from pack then you are doing it wrong (see the RME clause for the function).  If your implementation doesn't do that, then all you really need to do is shuffle the pack.  The cards aren't removed from the pack.  You're just returning a copy of the card, and increasing the <em>next</em> pointer variable in pack.</p>

<p>(possibly confusing analogy incoming) In reality, you would just remove the card from the pack.  In code implementation, it's more like you're sitting next to a copy machine and handing out copies of the cards while the pack is unchanged.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Ok then if the pack deals the 24th card, the next card to be dealt is the 1st card?  Simple as that?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The pack will never deal all the cards (5 cards to 4 players is 20, so 3 are always buried).  If you do deal 24 cards (for whatever testing purposes), then you should reset the pointer or else you'll go out of your memory bounds if you try to deal more.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
I understand now: just shuffle pack for the next hand.  Thanks.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
When we use pack_deal_one to give players cards, it is as if we are removing them from the pack right?  Therefore, you would have to put the Cards back into the pack and then reshuffle?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As the title suggests, I'm getting a compilation error from the autograder when running test Player_tests.  It's the very last test the autograder does.  I'm passing all other tests before it.  I also tried running the makefile for my player_tests on a caen environment (as opposed to local), but I passed that.  Then I ran the makefile for test on the caen environment, and that ran successfully too.</p>

<p>So...what do?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Player tests compilation error</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Maybe something wasn't initialized properly, causing whatever was in memory to be used. If you get lucky, the thing in memory is what you want.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>int x;</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>int x=0;</pre>
<p>could make all the difference.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Unless I'm not understanding your suggestion, that doesn't seem to be the problem.  Putting in:</p>

<pre>int x;<br />if (x)<br />return true;</pre>
<p>Will give me an error when compiling, so I know I'm not doing that anywhere (and I just checked over my code).</p></TEXT>

<p>I just got a file from the autograder ("submission_file") from the p3 checkpoint with no accompanying text. Normally, when I get an email with my submission, it has some text about what test cases I passed, style comments, etc. Was I supposed to get style and test case comments?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Autograder results</TEXT>

<p>I got the same thing, and am curious as well.</p></TEXT>

<p>Mine was empty. But when you submitted you should know if your files passed the published test cases. I think the checkpoint is graded all or nothing.</p></TEXT>

<p>This means that in the first round of making trump, everyone from Cathy to Bob passed. Then, because trump wasn't made in the first round, the players rejected Spades and moved on to the second round of making trump. In this second round, the first person to order up or pass was Cathy, and she chose to order up. </p>

<p>It would have been screw the dealer if everyone from Cathy to Alice passed in the second round; then, because a trump suit would not have been declared, Bob the dealer would have been forced to order up Clubs. But in this case the players didn't reach that point.</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yup - if Bob is the dealer and the player directly to his left is Cathy, and Cathy decides to order up right away, we would just print the dealer, the turn up, and Cathy orders up Spades.</p></TEXT>

<p>The last parameter that Game_init takes is an array, const char *const player_names[ ], but there is no array of player names. In the spec it tells us to (in main) only check for the specified errors, cout any errors if any, and then call Game_init and Game_play. However, since there is no array or player names, how can we call Game_init? </p>

<p>Are we supposed to create our own array within main and assign each argv element accordingly, then put that in our call to Game_init? </p>

<p>Additionally, are we supposed to do something similar for the bool shuffle? As in, do we create an arbitrary bool variable and use strcmp to determine whether it wants shuffle or noshuffle, and use that to call in Game_init?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Game_init in euchre.cpp</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You need to use your inputs to create an array of players. Then you can pass in that array from there. Hint: argv[].</p>

<p>You do so in main before passing that array into Game_init.</p>

<p>Yes. If the input is noshuffle you pass in false to Game_init. If the input is shuffle you pass in true to Game_init.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Got it, thank you! I got a bit confused because in one part of the spec, it said to "find errors and print them" and in another part, it said to use given error message if there were any errors.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah that's understandable - I think what the spec means (if I'm reading it correctly) is to print the user's arguments if they don't contain any errors, the way they're printed in the sample output. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry, I'm a bit confused. Do we print the exact user command line prompts if there's an error or do we print "Usage: euchre PACK_FILENAME [shuffle | noshuffle] POINTS_TO_WIN NAME1 NAME2 NAME3 NAME4" after calling exit(EXIT_FAILURE)</p></TEXT>

<p>Yeah, it's just a different way of writing it. The way it's given in the header has each function parameter on a separate line, maybe just for readability or whatnot.

 <TEXT>
Player_add_card input</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can add cards wherever you want in your hand. As far as the card that is passed to Player_add_card(), that depends on the code that you write that calls that function. Our autograder unit-test cases will always obey the RMEs when calling a function. But, the same might not necessarily be true of your own code (e.g. in Game.cpp) if you happen to have a bug.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm assuming we should call Pack_deal_one in our function that deals cards to the players in the 3-2-3-2, 2-3-2-3 fashion described in the specs. Even though the Pack_deal_one fxn. increments the next pointer, how is it okay that it keeps the dealt card in the pack? If we are to call this function to deal cards, don't we also need to discard the dealt card from the pack? Do we then need to write our own function to discard cards from pack?</p></TEXT>

<p>Why do you think you need to remove the card from the pack?  If you do so, you're going to have a pain trying to shuffle the deck for the next deal.

<p>Diamonds is the trump suit. Because of this, the Jack of Hearts is also a Diamond because it is the left bower. Therefore. the Jack of hearts is the highest card drew has that follows suit. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ohh, that makes sense! Thank you.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
yeah, my bad. Had a suit dyslexic moment there :)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thank you for the explanation, but it still doesn't make sense, because in euchre_test01.out.correct, it states:</p>

<p>"Hand 0<br />Alice deals<br />Ace of Diamonds turned up<br />Bob passes<br />Cathy passes<br />Drew passes<br />Alice orders up Diamonds"</p>

<p>So Diamonds is actually the trump suit, not Hearts. Is there any other explanation for why Drew would play Jack of Hearts rather than Ten of Diamonds?</p></TEXT>

<p>I just switched to computer science, and don't have any experience on my resume pertaining to this field. Besides taking eecs 183 and this class, I have no other experience. How can I market myself to employers for internships without having any experience besides class work? Thanks :)</p></TEXT>

No Computer Science Experience on Resume for Internships Advice</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you don't have experience, you have two options:</p>
<ul><li>Brag about your knowledge and experience from class [which they'll expect at the very least]</li><li>Get experience outside of class [shows your interests and passion, as well as broader experience]</li></ul>

<p>After EECS 280, you'll be able to talk about key aspects, such as how memory allocation works as well as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Get on top of these aspects and be able to talk about them at the very least for C++. They're unfortunately common in technical interviews [I found this out the hard way]. Additionally, talk about your in-class projects [if that's all you have that's relatable to the internship] in-depth, with an aspect on how complex it was and the way you approached each aspect of the project.</p>

<p>However, you should try to get out-of-class experience- that way, you'll be able to brag about other experiences and be easier to remember than that "generic" person.</p>

<p>------------------</p>

<p>What I personally did is pick up a project, and simply do it. For a first project, pick something "simple" yet interesting. For example, if it's a game, then pick a basic sort of game rather than something entirely new and ground-breaking. If it's a mobile application, pick something that will work and give you satisfaction in completing it, but don't plan on it being complex at all. The key is to start out <strong>completing</strong> something small, and <em>then</em> go for bigger projects.</p>

<p>Personal Experience: <em>[formatted so you can easily skip over if you'd like]</em><br /> <tt>For me, this was creating a game, which I suggest you do as well as a) they're as flexible and as imaginative yet as simple as you want, and b) anyone can enjoy and give you feedback on it. Now, my more specific suggestion is to use the </tt><a target="_blank" href="http://unity3d.com">Unity3D</a><tt> engine's free version, follow up on some of these complete </tt><a target="_blank" href="http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules">project tutorials</a><tt>, and then try to make it a simple yet complete game. I say start out simple, as many try to start out with grand ideas but never finish. You'll need to do some research on your own [ie Youtube and other places] and maybe use their forums for additional help as everything will be new, but it's a fairly good place to start off.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Although I made a game and have a few interesting ideas, I hate creating art and so put that away for half a year now [until I find a team]. In other words, to create great games, you either need to be a jack of all trades or work in a team. The latter is amazing, but for a complete learning experience, feel free to work independently. I now work on Android development since this summer and actually have a job creating an application at the moment, so if you'd like information for getting started with that, ask in a follow-up and I'll give quite a few resources.</tt></p>

<p>Whatever you start off with, make sure it's something you're interested in <em>and</em> can find learning resources for. I personally love "complete" project tutorials, that go from the basics and make something simple that works by itself. This will give you the idea of the overall idea of what type of category you're working in, whether it's a PC, web, or mobile application. Feel free to pick nearly any category with any programming language no matter prior experience, but make sure you're interested and have enough learning resources to create a first, simple project.</p>

<p>[Also, when people ask you why you made the game or other project, just don't say that it was for experience for the job- say something that'll show some sparkle in your eyes and show off your personal motivation and interests]</p>

<p>Now then, you'll probably make this first project independently and want to work on something bigger. This is where I'll put a little insert about the different engineering clubs on campus- join one, particularly the project teams [ie, Solar Car, UM:Autonomy [yay], MAAV, etc]. Work with other people and gain more experience that you can brag about to employers. I still say make a first complete independent personal project as it'll give you out-of-class experience and you won't feel as lost in the project team at first.</p>

<p>As a side note, if you want help from people on campus who are open to help you get started on a personal project, feel free to ask and I'll get you connected. Particularly, Michigan Hackers hosts "Hack Nights," which are basically evenings where anyone can come to work on any sort of personal programming-ish project, and there'll be plenty of other experienced people around to help out.</p>

<p>Just a put-together list about possible things to do to improve chances at marketability:</p>

<p>1. Get a good grade in EECS 280. I've heard that a applicant's grade in this course can impact the decision of a company to offer them an internship.</p>

<p>2. Learn the EECS material by yourself. Self-studying advanced material can be beneficial because it shows to a company that a student is driven to learn and improve. There are many online resources for doing this.</p>

<p>3. Join clubs, and attend events related to EECS if you possess a hunger to learn more, are interested in certain topics presented at these clubs/events, and/or want to make new friends and have a good-time with like-minded individuals.</p>

<p>4. Work on self-projects. If there is a particular subject that interests you, try relating EECS to it and combine the both of them to create programs. Doing so and showing these projects to companies will show to them that the individual is not going to school just to get a degree, but rather is utilizing what they learn by applying it to real-world problems.</p>

<p>5. Take the approach of a business-major: network with individuals and be aggressive(desiring success, but not pushy) when in contact with potential employers. Let confidence in abilities ooze from mannerisms.</p>

<p>6. Potential research with professors in the (near-)future will help. If any of their fields is of particular interest, it might be a good idea to contact some about available positions.</p>

<p>7. Don't give up. Most EECS students that get top internships that lead to job offers generally get them in the summer after their junior year. Generally, this is after they've taken 281, which is a CORE KNOWLEDGE COURSE. The grade comments about 280 apply to 281 as well.</p>

<p>Best of luck in your endeavors!</p></TEXT>

<p>When I submit to the autograder, I pass all the tests except for the last one. I keep getting "Compilation error!" for Player_tests.</p>

<p>I don't understand what's wrong. Everything compiles and passes on the CAEN linux machine I'm using.

<p>Since Prof. Essl's office hours are on Monday, would we have to wait until next week to pick up our exams? My only concern is I know the regrade policy is a week (I'm assuming five business days), so I'm just curious if there will be a time pressure to submit any potential regrades.</p></TEXT>

<p>We have extended the regrade deadline to 3 Nov for the midterm for this reason.</p></TEXT>

<p>The syllabus says low B, I'm not sure if that means a B- or an actual 3.0 B</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Probably right on the boundary, like all other EECS classes. They will stick a B at the median student and the average GPA will probably be something like 2.85.</p>

<p>BTW, I think this would include everybody who took this midterm, even if they end up dropping the class.</p></TEXT>

<p>How is the extra credit score accounted for in our final grade? Is it tacked on to our points for discussion exercises? I guess my question is: how is the 1 extra credit point weighted relative to our other course points?</p></TEXT>

<p>What is the extra credit score for? Unfortunately, I don't have a definitive recollection of this.</p>

<p>Can you give us examples of how the class was curved before? And whether it's even curved if the median is in the 80's range? i.e. What percentage grade in the class meant a B, what percentage grade in the class meant an A, etc. in previous semesters.</p>

<p>I have a question about the playing order.</p>
<p>According to the project spec, the rule for playing was</p>

<p><em>"If a player can follow suit, he plays the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, he plays the lowest card in his hand"</em></p>

<p>but in the file euchre_test00.out.correct, why would the player Cathy play <strong>nine of clubs</strong> and <strong>ten of clubs</strong> before the <strong> queen of spades</strong>? Isn't clubs superior to spades?</p>

<p>And also, why would Cathy not play the <strong>queen of spades</strong> instead of <strong>jack of spades</strong> when drew led with the <strong>king of clubs</strong> ?</p>

<pre>Jack of Spades led by Bob
<strong>King of Spades played by Cathy</strong>
Ace of Spades played by Drew
Nine of Diamonds played by Alice
Drew takes the trick
King of Clubs led by Drew
Ace of Clubs played by Alice
Nine of Spades played by Bob
<strong>Jack of Clubs played by Cathy</strong>
Alice takes the trick
Ten of Diamonds led by Alice
Ten of Spades played by Bob
<strong>Nine of Clubs played by Cathy</strong>
Queen of Clubs played by Drew
Alice takes the trick
Jack of Hearts led by Alice
Ace of Hearts played by Bob
<strong>Ten of Clubs played by Cathy</strong>
Ten of Hearts played by Drew
Alice takes the trick
Queen of Hearts led by Alice
King of Hearts played by Bob
<strong>Queen of Spades played by Cathy</strong>
Nine of Hearts played by Drew
Bob takes the trick</pre>

Confusion about lowest Card and highest Card</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm confused. Cathy doesn't have the Jack of Spades, Bob does. When you can follow suit, you play the HIGHEST card OF THAT SUIT. When you can't, you play the LOWEST card IN YOUR WHOLE HAND. So, first you must follow suit and play the highest you can to try and win the trick. If you cannot do that, you play the lowest card possible, first going by rank, and if you have two cards of the same rank, you play the card with the lowest suit. Does that answer your question?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ignore my last line about the highest card (i realized it after posting it) but the lowest card still confuses me</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>*Not considering trump* Yes clubs is superior to spades, but you look at the rank of the card before you look at the suit. A queen of clubs is higher than a queen of spades, yes. BUT a queen of spades is higher than a nine of clubs or a ten of clubs, or any cards lower in rank than a queen. Does that make sense? There's a paragraph in the spec outlining how you should rank the cards in terms of rank, suit, considering trump, etc.</p></TEXT>

<p>After a hand/round of playing is completed and points for a team have been scored, should we shuffle the pack using the previous pack's card order? I.E after shuffling the pack 3x for the first round, the pack's card order for the 2nd round will be 3x shuffle the pack order that was used for the first round?</p>

<p>Also for noshuffle, wouldn't the same team win the round everytime because everyone will have the same hand?</p>

<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>

<p>For the second part I guess it would be the same every time so that's probably why the test case for noshuffle only plays to one point.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think the cards for no shuffle will be the same, yes. But the difference is who receives them because the dealer still changes!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So you have an initial deck that is specified in pack.in. When you initialize the pack, you do not shuffle. In your Game.cpp, at the beginning of each hand, you shuffle the deck. So, right before you start hand 0 you shuffle the deck to say deck0. Then you play the hand. Then, right before you start hand 1, you take the deck that you have, and you shuffle it again. So now you have deck1, which is equivalent to shuffling the input deck twice.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Im still confused. For example, during hand 0 we shuffle the cards in pack.in using the 3x method. Now for hand 1 (the next hand) do we take the pack.in again and shuffle it (effectively yielding the same shuffled pack as in the last hand) or do we take the shuffled cards in hand 0 and shuffle them again (so 3x method twice) or do we do something else? Thanks.</p></TEXT>

Dealing the cards</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Best way I can think of with the least amount of loops is to have two loops, and two loops in those loops. The first outer loop would go through twice, then the first inner would deal 3 cards, the second inner loop would deal 2 cards. This would essentially deal the first round of cards. You can do the same for the second loop, but deal two cards then three cards. Again, there might be a better way of doing this, but that's the least repetitive I could come up with.</p></TEXT>

<p>For future reference, the reason you got the number 49 is that the <em>character</em> '1' is character code 49 in ASCII. By using *argv[3], you passed the dereferenced char at index 0 of argv[3], which was '1'. But, because chars are integer types, this is (unfortunately, imho) legal to do--it simply passes a 1 byte integer of value 49. </p></TEXT>

<p>For dealing the cards, can we assume player[0] will always be the one dealing at the beginning? so that means player[1] would be the first one to get cards?</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>Since you said "at the beginning", then yeah, you're correct. Just be sure to increment the dealer every hand.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm not sure that you can assume that. At the beginning of the game, the dealer is Player 0, and after every hand the dealer moves one player to the left. If you always had the dealer fixed at Player 0, you'd have to shift the players' numbers over for each new hand, which might complicate things because partnerships are fixed at players 0/2 and 1/3, so if you shift player numbers you also have to shift partnerships. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Of course, it's probably possible to do it your way - just not sure if it'd be more difficult.</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>That prints the current score for the entire game, not just the score increases from the previous round. In Hand 0, Alice and Cathy won one point because they won four tricks. Since they didn't win any points in Hand 1, they still have 1 point after Hand 1. as 1 + 0 = 1.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>So the specifications state:</p>
<p>1) "The complete ordering of all the cards is [all trump cards (including left bower)]].  The aces of the remaining three suits follow in suit order, the remaining kings in suit order, ..., and finally the remaining nines in suit order."</p>
<p>2) "If a player can follow suit, he plays the highest card that follows suit.  Otherwise, he plays the lowest card in his hand."</p>

<p>The first trick in euchre_test01.out.correct does not appear to follow this rule?  The file reads:</p>

<p>Hand 0<br />Alice deals<br />Ace of Diamonds turned up<br />Bob passes<br />Cathy passes<br />Drew passes<br />Alice orders up Diamonds</p>
<p>Ace of Spades led by Bob<br />Nine of Hearts played by Cathy<br />Queen of Hearts played by Drew<br /><strong>Ace of Hearts played by Alice</strong><br />Bob takes the trick</p>

<p>Why does Alice play the ace of hearts and not the nine of clubs?  She doesn't have any cards that follow suit (spades), and aces are supposed to be higher than nines, regardless of suit order.  Moreover, neither the ace of hearts nor the nine of clubs is a trump card, so they should be compared solely based on rank...  According to the cards I have shuffled by hand and dealt according to the specifications, Alice has the ace of hearts, nine of clubs, and jack-queen-king of diamonds.  Given that everyone else's cards played in the euchre_test00.out.correct file matched my output and my output has matched this out.correct file up until this point, I am fairly confident this is a card_compare issue, but I don't know why my solution is incorrect.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm failing both on local Linux and in the autograder.

When I open up my .out files and run the text against the text in the .out.correct files on diffchecker.com, I get the message that the two files are identical (I'm not including the command line arguments when I copy the .out.correct files on diffchecker.com).  Are we supposed to remove the top line on the .out.correct files before using the makefile test?</p>

<p>Sort of. That works when you're playing fewer than 4 hands since the players are numbered 0 - 3, and player 0 is dealer at hand 0, etc. Once you get to hand 4, player 0 becomes dealer again. (Some have said that the mod operator might be useful here). </p></TEXT>

<p>If its round 2 of making trump, i know the player has to have a face card that is of the same color of the suit of the upcard but does it also count if its the same suit as the upcard?</p>


<p>For example if the upcard was hearts, and the player has a jack of hearts would this be considered as enough to make trump??</p>
<p>or does it have to be a face card of the suit diamonds?</p>

<p>thanks</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Make Trump Question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, a Jack of Hearts counts as the left-bower if diamonds is the trump being considered. Thus, a player with this card would order up diamonds.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>However, if you have an Ace of Hearts, and it's the second round, you would not order up based on this card. You would only order up if you have a face-card of diamonds or if you have the Jack of Hearts (functionally a diamond because it would be the left bower).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The right bower is the jack of the trump suit. In our case, diamonds is the trump suit, so Jack of diamonds is the right bower. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
I thought we were talking about the second round? The first round, yes the jack of hearts would be the right bower if the upcard is hearts. The second round, you are considering hearts as trump suit, and so the jack of hearts would be the left bower.</TEXT>

<p>So I made a helper function to shuffle(or not shuffle) and then deal out the cards to each player. What is the best way to go about this? Is there anyway to use the Player_add_Card function? because when I tried using it it gave me a compile error, something about temporary memory. So, i just used the Player_deal_one function, but this means i have to manually set my hand_size to 5…is this okay? We can assume the hand size will always be 5 for every player,right?</p>

<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Dealing Cards</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You cannot just automatically set the hand size to be 5. It will cause other issues during the actual game.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think you need to use Player_add_card for the dealing process. The point of that function is to give cards to a player, and when you're dealing you're taking cards out of the pack and giving them to the players. As a side note: are you using XCode? If so, is the compile error something about "taking the address of a temporary object"?</p></TEXT>

<p>No,I'm using linux. And yes tats exactly what the compile error was! do you know what it means and how to get around it?</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>no because player_add_Card is void..i was taking the address of the return value of player_Deal_one…i don't know how to get around this error</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry yeah I meant Pack_deal_one not Player_add_card. You can't take the address of the return value of Pack_deal_one because the return value is a temporary object. Try storing the result in a temp variable and taking the address of that.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi all, I'm just wondering what types of things you've been testing beyond the published test cases for euchre_test00 and euchre_test01. I've been testing my Card/Player/Pack functions in a little more depth, but I'm still not entirely sure how I can make sure that the full euchre program is working appropriately.

<p>In the "Dos and Don'ts" section of the Project 3 spec, it reads:</p>
<pre>DO: Pass by const pointer when appropriate<br />DON'T: "I don't think I'll modify it..."</pre>


<p>Does this refer to passing arguments of the form:</p>
<pre>const T *ptr</pre>
<p>or does it refer to</p>
<pre>T *const ptr</pre>

<p>Any clarification would be appreciated.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
"Pass by const pointer when appropriate"</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Both. Any time you are going to pass something somewhere and you shouldn't modify it, make it const. So many bugs are caught this way because you accidentally modified something that you didn't want to modify.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Vidal did say in his review session (if you went) that making a <strong>pointer itself</strong> const is rarely used. Most often, you are making the <strong>thing being pointed to</strong> const.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thank you for the response. I have a question about the second way, though: since the pointer passed into the function is just a copy of the original pointer, why is it important to make the copied pointer constant, when other passed-by-value data types such as ints aren't usually made constant? In other words, the "risk" that I see with not declaring the copied pointer constant would be that I could change the copied pointer, and then later on in the function, I might dereference it, expecting to get the original value. But that mistake is the same as if I were to change the value of a passed-by-value int, and then later in the function, use that int expecting the original passed value.</p>

<p>The only reason I bring this up is because I've noticed that none of the instructor-provided functions that we are expected to complete in Card.h, Pack.h, Player.h, and Game.h use the second way of making pointers constant; they only use the first way.</p></TEXT>

<p>Correct. The rule is you MUST follow suit if you are able to. If you are not able to, I guess you just don't wanna waste a trump card...in reality, you are free to use a trump card if you feel like that could be your best move, but they want there to be a single solution so that the grading is easier and so that implementing is easier.</p></TEXT>

<p>In the event you can't follow suit and are trying to play your lowest card, which of these should be played?</p>

<p>Trump is Diamond</p>

<p>Technically, the Ace of Hearts would be of lower value but the sample output shows that Queen of Diamonds should be played.</p>

<p><strong>Jack of Spades led by Bob</strong></p>
<p><strong>King of Spades played by Cathy</strong></p>
<p>Ace of Spades played by Drew</p>
<p>Nine of Diamonds played by Alice</p>
<p>Drew takes the trick</p>

<p>I'm a little confused as to why Cathy played King of Spades. She has a Jack of Clubs, which is the left bower, so why doesn't she play that instead?</p>

<p>I seem to be misunderstanding the rules of the game. I'll share what my understanding of the rules are: if Bob is leading with a Jack of Spades, then Spades becomes like a "temporary trump." At the end of this round, since Jack of Spades is the right bower, Bob should take the trick.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is wrong. Can someone clarify how to determine which cards to play and which cards take the trick?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
test.00.out.correct Confusion</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So in this hand, trump is Hearts ("Jack of Diamonds turned up...Bob orders up Hearts"). Trump doesn't change from trick to trick - for all 5 tricks in the hand, the trump suit is heart. What does change is the lead suit, or the suit of the card put down by the leader of each trick. In this trick, Bob plays Spades as lead, so the suit ranking for this trick is Trump (Jack Hearts, Jack Diamonds, all other Hearts), then lead cards (Ace Spades through Nine Spades), then the two other suits in suit order. So no, Spades has not become a "temporary trump" - it has become "elevated" relative to the other two non-trump suits, but Hearts is still the actual trump. And because Spades is not trump, the rules about left bower and right bower don't apply to it, so the King of Spades in this context is of higher value than the Jack of Clubs.</p>

<p>Hopefully that makes sense. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yup, in that case since the lead suit is trump, everyone will have to play a trump if they have one, and left and right bower rules always apply to the trump suit. So if trump is Spades, the highest card you can play is the Jack of Spades, then Jack of Clubs, then Ace of Spades, etc...</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Just to add to this question. Let's assume from the above example that trump is Spades. Bob leads with a trump. And all the players still put down the cards we see above. Because now the lead card suit = trump, would the left bower and right bower rules now apply?</p></TEXT>

<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>We will NOT be compiling <strong>Pack.cpp</strong> with your Player tests. If you find yourself wanting to use Pack to test Player, you should re-think your testing strategy."</em></p>

<p>My questions:</p>
<p>1) I don't understand the announcement, can somebody clarify?</p>
<p>2) Are we supposed to submit something other than the final-submit.tar.gz?<br />3) All I did was punch in "make final-tar," as it said in the specifications, is this okay or should I submit something else?<br />4) Are we being graded on how well our test cases find bugs like in EECS 183?<br /><br />Thanks for all and any help!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Questions regarding final submission.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No worries, this has <strong>nothing</strong> to do with final submission. To make the announcement clearer:</p>
<p>&gt; For compiling "Player_tests" [ie, "make Player_tests"], the above is the correct command to do so<br />&gt; The previous command <em>required</em> Pack.cpp, but you don't need it at all just to test Player.cpp</p>

<p>So yeah, no worries with regards to final submission. You don't even need to recompile Player_tests or follow this announcement at all, if you already got the Checkpoint- it's just a "clarification"/"we made a mistake, and also here's why it's a mistake."<br /><br />Now, for being graded on how well the test cases find bugs, you should look at the email you should have gotten for Project2. If you look at it, you get feedback on how well your test cases were written. Essentially, were they too narrow/not enough in them, were they extensive enough to catch plenty of bugs, etc. Grade-wise, if you have at least one test per function [for Card, Pack, and Player], you're all good.</p></TEXT>

<p>Suppose a Jack of Clubs is turned up. When making, do the players search their hands for only club face cards, or do they search for spade face cards too? I guess my question is can someone order up spades during the first round if a club is turned up?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
question about the spec</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When you're making you only need to worry about the suit of the upcard, so you just need to consider Clubs, which includes the Jack of Spades. The reason for this is you need to declare which suit is trump before you can define the Left Bower, who has the property of the different suit.</p></TEXT>

<p>When would the deck ever reach screw the dealer, since the dealer would order up on the second round anyway due to having at least one face card of the opposite suit in their hand?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Screw the Dealer</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Here is my understanding:</p>
<p>Screw the dealer: if making reaches the dealer in round 2, the dealer must order up the suit of the opposite color as the up card. I think that the dealer can't decide whether to to order up in round 2; they're forced to automatically order up, so they're screwed. Provided the spec's explanation below. Hope this helps.</p>


<p>From the spec:</p>
<p>If making reaches the dealer during the second round, we invoke screw the dealer, where the dealer is FORCED TO order up. In the case of screw the dealer, the dealer will always order up the suit with the same color as the same color as the up card.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In a full run through of the game using the strategy dictated in the specs, the dealer would, in fact, have a card to order up with. Instead, this scenario would get tested using unit tests. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The dealer will always have a card of the same color and opposite suit as the up card when it reaches his turn to make in the second round. However, since he doesn't get the opportunity to decide whether to order up in the second round, isn't this unimportant because he is forced to order up anyway when it reaches his turn to make in the second round?</p></TEXT>

<p>From the spec: "After the Pack file is open, you may assume that there are exactly 24 unique and correctly formatted cards. In other words, you don’t have to worry about checking the contents of the file for errors." So you need to check that the pack opens properly and print an error message if the file open operation fails, but you don't need to check that card names are misspelled or cards are repeated. </p></TEXT>

<p>When testing our output vs the sample output, the same card is flipped over and bob, cathy, and drew are all dealt the correct 5 cards. But somehow Alice is not being dealt the correct hand.. This essentially means it can't be a problem with shuffle or some other functions... any idea how/why this could be happening?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>

<p>It may be a shuffle problem. Or it could be a pack init problem. Or it could be a problem with the way you are dealing the cards. Or some other one that may not be so obvious.</p></TEXT>

<p>I was wondering for this test case of Player_playe_card if the trump suit was Diamonds and the led_card was suit diamonds and Drew had: Jack of Hearts, Jack of Diamonds, and Ten of Diamonds. What does he play? Can you explain why please?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Euchre player_play_card</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If the player can follow suit, then he plays the highest card that follows the suit.  In this case, the highest card in this case is the Jack of Diamonds because it is the right bower (it is a diamond, and is better than the Jack of Hearts and ten of diamonds).</p>

<p>Now go watch the football game.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm assuming that this function will only be used whenever a player orders up at the beginning of each hand. If that's right, is this function only supposed to do simple comparisons between cards? Or do we need to take the suit of the upcard in consideration as well?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Questions about Player_add_and_discard</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The upcard is trump, so you need to make sure that you get the correct trump suit from the upcard.  Using trump, you should then compare the cards.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So in <code>euchre_test00.out.correct</code> and <tt>euchre_test01.out.correct </tt>the first line is the command, e.g.</p>
<pre>./euchre pack.in shuffle 10 Alice Bob Cathy Drew </pre>

<p>So, should we cout argv on run of our euchre.cpp main function?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Question re: euchre_test0X.out.correct</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yup, provided there are no errors, print the arguments at the very beginning.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Are we supposed to cout the outputs on gamp.cpp?</p>
<p>After calling Game_play, do we need to have the exact same output as the file that was given to us?</p>
<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Game.cpp</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If I'm understanding your question, executing the functions in game.cpp should result in the same output being produced in the published test files that were given to us. That includes printing the process of playing a hand, making trump, winning tricks, and publishing the score. Both the spec and the published test cases give a little bit more background on what the output should look like for each step.</p></TEXT>

<p>however the autograder gives "compilation error!" for Player_test00, euchre_test00, euchre_test01, and Player_tests</p>

<p>Not sure what would cause everything to compile on the CAEN linux machine but not in the autograder.</p>

make test works... autograder gives compilation errors</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>double check that you are #including the correct things in all the folders, it could compile just fine on your machine when you compile everything together but I believe we might check your individual files with our own other files and by #including the wrong thing it could result in a compiler error.</p>

<p>go back through your code and make sure what you are including makes sense</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't know about euchre, but I had pack included for my player_tests, and that was the reason I got a compilation error on the autograder.  The makefile had pack.cpp being compiled with player_tests, but the autograder did not (and it was said in the recent announcement that you should not use pack with player_tests).  So, player_tests should only include Player.h.  Following this, euchre and game should only include Game.h, and none of the other header files (though I'm not sure if that will fix the compilation problem).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm a bit confused at what is supposed to happen at the end of a hand. The pack gets reset I'm sure but is it supposed to always reshuffle the deck or does it just depend on whether the argument passed in is "shuffle" or "noshuffle"?</p></TEXT>

<p>If the shuffle option is passed, then the deck gets shuffled before each hand. Otherwise, the pack just gets reset.</p></TEXT>

<p>Yes the leader changes after each trick. From the spec: "At the end of a trick, played cards are discarded. The winner of the trick (or round) leads the next." Also, print the score after each hand; look at the .out files provided if you want examples on correct output.</p></TEXT>

We honestly can't give you any help on this without knowing more about your code. Segfaults happen for a huge number of reasons. Have you run your code through GDB? You can run it there, wait for it to segfault, and then call "bt" (stands for backtrace) and it will tell you exactly what line your code segfaulted at.</TEXT>

<p>This may sound very dumb (and even incomprehensible) so bear with me. </p>

<p>I'll come up with a quick scenario. If player[2] is dealing, that means the first 3 cards are dealt to player[1], then 2 cards to player[0], and then 3 cards to player[3].</p>

<p>If player[2] is leading, that means he plays a card, then player[3] plays next, and then player[0] plays next.</p>

<p>Okay, so you get my drift. Initially, I thought everything would have been easy if we just looped the dealing and playing cards. But then I came across the problem of transitioning from 3 to 0 (and vice versa). Any advice in general on how we could think this through? Anything better than looping? Do I actually have to create 4 different if statements on how everything is dealt?</p></TEXT>

Dealer and Leading Indexing Help</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The first person to receive cards during the dealing process is the first person to the left of the dealer. For the purposes of this project, "left" means "the next index" - so if player[2] is dealing, the first person to receive cards would be player[3]. Since the players' indices are number 0 through 3, after 3 we go back to 0, and so on. Likewise, if player[2] is leading, player[3] plays next, then player[0], etc. </p>

<p>As for transitioning from index 3 to index 0, some people have suggested the mod operator. I just created a really brief function to make sure that the index "left of" 3 is 0; dunno how others did it. Hopefully that helps!! It's not a dumb question.</p></TEXT>

<p>Lol yeah, I actually don't know how playing circulates in a real game of euchre - I'm only going off what the spec says. No problem!</p></TEXT>

if there is a seg fault the auto grader should tell you that there is a seg fault. if the output is just different but it runs you should see a little bit of the output from your program and the expected output. go look at the autograder results again and see what your problem is</TEXT>

I'm running into a segmentation fault in Game_play.  Debugging revealed that the problem lied in my helper fcn, Game_shuffle.  I simply entered in 'noshuffle' to leave it out, ran it, and it worked. Ergo it works with an unshuffled deck.  So I"m a little confused that while my pack_shuffle fcn works and passes tests, my game_shuffle helper fcn results in a segmentation fault when I implement it.  Note I threw in a Card_print in Game_play.  gdb printed out "Cannot access memory at address 0x8003f5a00".  However Card_print was successful in printing cards w/unshuffled deck.  
Apologies for the lengthy post.</TEXT>

In the spec, it says "Eldest hand (player at left of the dealer, e.g., player 3 is left of player
2, and player 0 is left of player 3)"
Thus, the first command, which has Alice, Bob, Cathy, and Drew means P0: Alice  P3: Bob  P2: Cathy  P1 Drew?  If so the order of players[i] doesn't make for a nice for loop so should I do some sort of rearrange/reinit of the players' indexing?</TEXT>

<p>1). If we have to shuffle the deck, do we shuffle before we deal the first hand or do we deal the hand with the deck as is<br />2). is the player who leads card always the player left of dealer<br />3). will the upcard be the last card in the deck</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Questions about project 3</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
1). shuffle before dealing the first hand and every subsequent hand.
2). for the first trick, the player to the left of the dealer leads. After that, whoever won the last trick leads.
3). No. You will deal out the first 20 cards in the deck, and the 21st card will be the upcard (all you have to do is use the next pointer)

<p>Ace of Hearts</p>
<p>Nine of Clubs</p>

<p>After Alice picks up the Ace of Diamonds, she discards the Nine of Clubs (you should be calling Player_add_and_discard). After this, the lowest card that Alice has that isn't a Diamond is the Ace of Hearts.</p>

Bob takes the trick</pre>
<p>When Alice has the Ace of Hearts, Nine of Clubs, Jack of Diamonds, Queen of Diamonds, and King of Diamonds.</p>

<p>According to the spec, "If a player can follow suit, he plays the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, he plays the lowest card in his hand."</p>

<p>Alice clearly has a lower card than the Ace of Hearts – the Nine of Clubs. Why shouldn't this card be played?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>When I try to output Bob after my third line of code, Bob is just an upside down question mark</p>

<p>After a trick where Bob leads a card and Alice wins the trick,</p>
<p>I start a new trick in which Alice leads a card.</p>

<p>For some reason, right after the function call of Player_lead_card, I can't access the name of pointer Bob.</p>

<p>I'm confused because Player_lead_card uses Alice as an argument, so it shouldn't be changing anything about Bob. Any ideas on what went wrong?</p>


<p>Here's my code:</p>



<p>for (int i = 0; i &lt; num_tricks - 1; i++){</p>

<p>            cout &lt;&lt; endl;</p>
<p>            position_lead_player = winner_of_trick_pos;</p>
<p>            </p>
<p>            </p>

<p>            //////</p>
<p>            </p>
<p>   </p>

<p>            Card lead_card = Player_lead_card(&amp;game_ptr-&gt;players[position_lead_player], next_card-&gt;suit);</p>
<p>            </p>
<p>           </p>
<p>            </p>
<p>            //////bob doesnt print bob after this statement.</p>
<p>            //////</p>
<p>            //////</p>

<p>            Card_print(&amp;lead_card);</p>
<p>            cout &lt;&lt; " led by " &lt;&lt; game_ptr-&gt;players[position_lead_player].name &lt;&lt; endl;</p>

I think the standard that I've heard is that you should have at least one new (not provided by us) test per function, and that the test files should compile. Beyond the grading requirement, test functions will also be most useful to you if they test border cases (left bowers everywhere!), check pointer handling and array values, and make sure that functions work when used multiple times or together with others as well as as units.</TEXT>

<p>The way I'm attemping to deal involves setting a card equal to Pack_add_one and then using that card for Player_add_one. However, I've encountered an error where I get a segmentation fault if I try to Card_print the card I set equal to Pack_add_one, and I don't think they're being dealt properly, as well as if I try to Card_print the cards in the players hands. </p>

<p>In addition, I've noticed that simply declaring another card before dealing in game.cpp and not using it for anything is somehow effecting what card comes up as the flipcard for the orderup rounds after the deal. I'm sure this could be a wide variety of issues, but I'm kind've clueless as to what I should even be looking for, and I'd appreciate any ideas I could try.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>

<p>There's a way to do it! Right click the name of te project on the left side of the screen (i think the tray is called solution explorer) and the all the way at the bottom click properties. Click debug on the left side of the pop menu. There should be a prompt that says "command line arguments". Fill in the box with your arguments (./euchre pack.in etc) and click apply at the bottom. This makes it really easy to test the same game (test00 or test01) over and over. Google it to make sure of the process bc my explanation isn't great.</p></TEXT>

Have you run your code through GDB and then called "bt" to see where exactly its segfaulting?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
huh. So there are two possible reasons for this that I can think of: 1. you didn't compile with the -g flag, 2. you messed up a pointer somewhere and corrupted GDB. Does the rest of the function work?</TEXT>

<p>I'm compiling with "make euchre" does that not use the -g flag? And yes my Game_init and Game_play functions both work. Then I print "ok at this point" and the only thing I have after that is return 0 and somehow I'm getting a segmentation fault there</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
The makefile you downloaded compiles with the -O1 flag, not the -g flag. You'll have to edit it to compile with -g, then type "make clean" then retype "make euchre". let me know if that fixes your GDB problems</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Autograder final</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When you use diff to compare the output, are you using the -q option with it? The diff commands in the makefile's test has the -q flag, so if you just copied and pasted, you're probably using it. Try diff without -q, and see if you get some output.</p>

<p>Assuming that's not the issue, keep in mind that the autograder tests more than just the two examples we gave you. Write more test cases to try to find where your program doesn't behave exactly the way the spec says it should.</p></TEXT>

<p>In euchre, it also shows me with an error message game_ptr unitialized. I just declare game_ptr in euchre.cpp and initialized it with the game_ini function in game.cpp. It does not work. Does somebody knows the error?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
game_ptr unitialized</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
You have to first make a Game object, then you can make a pointer to it.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
You have to create a Game object before creating a pointer to it. I assume you're doing something like 
Game* Game_ptr;
and then passing that into your Game_init? What you have to do is create a Game object (Game game;) and then pass the address of that object into Game_init. 
The reason for this is that creating a pointer to a type doesn't mean you have an object of that type. Declaring int *i doesn't mean that you own a pointer that points to an integer that sits somewhere in memory. It means that you own a pointer that is uninitialized that should be pointing to an integer, but you don't own an integer for it to be pointing to, and thus it is uninitialized and points to NULL. 
tl;dr you have to actually own an object of the type you're trying to point to before you try and pass a pointer anywhere.</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>That means you passed in a value as a Suit parameter to Suit_next that wasn't one of SPADES, HEARTS, CLUBS, or DIAMONDS, since the default case of the switch statement is to assert(0) and crash the program. Take a look at where you're calling the function Suit_next() and see where or how you might be passing it illegal values.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Yeah, somehow you're trying to do Suit_next on something that isn't a valid suit within the cases, and so it defaults to the assert(0) case. You might be trying to do a Suit_next of a card that hasn't had its suit initialized (and so the suit value is just nonsense) or you may have overwritten it with some bad pointer/array stuff.</TEXT>

After they are initially input through the command line, these are passed in to Game_init to set their values inside the Game struct. From then on, the game can refer to these and get the information internally, rather than needing to pass around by parameter or otherwise refer back to the command line inputs. They're on the command line in order to get something to initialize the Game with, and they're inside the game so they can be used later.</TEXT>

what are you returning in your main function? you should have "return 0;" at the end of main()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My main function in euchre.cpp is like this:</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {</p>
<p>...............</p>
<p>    return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>But I did not see any wrong with it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>for us, this meant a seg fault-- we were making an error in the memory we were trying to access with our indexing</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Quick questions for getting shuffle and player names from the arguments to main.</p>

<p>For shuffle, I want to make a bool true if the argument is equal to "shuffle" and false otherwise. Would this be the correct way to do this:</p>

<p>if (strcmp(argv[2], "shuffle") == 0)<br />    {<br />        bool shuffle = true;<br />    }<br />    else<br />    {<br />        bool shuffle = false;<br />    }</p>

<p>Because I'm getting an error that says shuffle is unused which makes me think the function never gets into the if statement.</p>

<p>Also, for creating an array of player names from the arguments, I tried doing this:</p>

<p>const char *const player_names[4];<br />    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++)<br />    {<br />        player_names[i] = argv[i+4];<br />    }</p>

<p>and got an error saying i can't change a read-only location (player_names). How can I make an array and add names to it that has to be constant when it's passed to Game_init?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Shuffle and player_names</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For your shuffle boolean, you want to declare bool shuffle before you get into your if/else blocks. The scope of a local variable is its curly brackets, so you have a boolean called shuffle in the if block and a boolean called shuffle in the else block, and they both cease to exist before you do anything with them.</p>

<p>For your array of player names, ask yourself if you really need to make an array in main to hold the player names from the arguments and then pass that to Game_init. Is there a way to pass the player names from argv directly to Game_init?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
You can pass argv wherever you'd like what do whatever you want with it :) I wouldn't pass the whole of argv into Game_init though, just the useful parts.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For the player names, could I just pass argv then to Game_init? And within Game_init, access the player names by using proper indexing? And same for pack_filename, I could just pass *argv in for that and use indexing in Game_init to access it?</p></TEXT>

<p>Our player_lead_card function is passing most of the test cases but when I tried testing:</p>

<p>Trump: HEARTS,</p>

<p>it's causing an error.</p>
<p>After I call the function, the cards in player's hand are:</p>
<p>jack_diamonds, ace_hearts, ten_clubs, nine_hearts, nine_hearts.</p>

<p>So the first card gets discarded, the last card is added so we end up having 2 nine_hearts and the lead card doesn't get discarded from hand. Does anyone know what could possibly be causing this?</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>Is Player_lead_card returning the jack of hearts? In that case you've got a problem with the logic that should choose ten of clubs.</p>
<p>Or is it returning ten of clubs, but removing the wrong card from the hand? If that's the case, you want to look at how you're removing a card.</p>
<p>In either case, compile your code with the -g flag instead of -O1, and run it using gdb. Debugging will be so much easier when you step through line by line and see which variables have the values you think they should and which don't.</p></TEXT>

<p>Do you have a cout &lt;&lt; endl; after you finish the for loop? Maybe you just need to flush the buffer. Besides, you'll want a line break before your next line of output.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>To clarify on buffers, cout is what's called a "buffered stream". The stuff you output to it doesn't get sent out right away, it waits in a buffer. One way to send the information from the buffer to where you want it to go is by using an endl, which besides outputting the line ending character(s), flushes the buffer.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, I have a cout &lt;&lt; endl; after the for loop. What do you mean by "flush the buffer"? I tried this code on visual studio and the space appeared at the end of Drew. When I move all of my files and try to compile/run it on linux, the space isn't being printed at the end. This should be a simple problem to fix, but the space isn't being printed at all for some reason. All of the lines printed in the game function are correct and they are identical to that of the euchre_test00.out.correct</p></TEXT>

<p>1. In the project spec, the example code is compiled using -g. Is this necessary, or will valgrind work properly without it? (The reason I ask is because the default makefile does not use -g)</p>

<p>2. What does the output mean when it reads "(suppressed: 6 from 6)"? Are these errors? Also, what does it mean by "rerun with -v"? When I type "valgrind -v &lt;command&gt;", I get a huge wall of text that I don't understand.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Valgrind Questions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>1. Use the -g flag to compile for valgrind. Compiling with -g includes the debugging info in your output file. This makes it so that if valgrind wants to tell you about an error, it can give you the file name and line number. You don't want to try to find an error without this info.</p>

<p>2. According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#manual-core.suppress">Valgrind manual</a>, "The error-checking tools detect numerous problems in the system libraries, such as the C library, which come pre-installed with your OS. You can't easily fix these, but you don't want to see these errors (and yes, there are many!) So Valgrind reads a list of errors to suppress at startup."</p>
<p>-v is for verbose mode; if you run Valgrind that way, you're going to get a lot of detail, including stuff you really don't need. Since you don't need to worry about the suppressed errors, you don't need to look at them with -v.</p></TEXT>

<p>Read on. "When playing a card, players use a simple strategy that considers only the suit that was led...If a player can follow suit, he plays the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, he plays the lowest card in his hand."</p>

<p>So play the highest card of the lead suit if possible, or else just play the lowest card in the hand.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Where is your test case coming from? Are you 100% sure that the Q-D, A-H, J-D, K-D hand that you describe is what Alice actually has in her hand at that time? This looks close to, but not exactly like, Alice's hand for the second trick of test01.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Alice should have: </p>
<p>k of d<br />a of d<br />j of d<br />q of d<br />a of h</p>

<p>And the trump suit is Diamonds. So does alice play jack of diamonds because that is the highest card of the trump suit? Or does she play queen of diamonds because she cannot follow the lead suit? </p>

<p>I guess I'm confused as to whether the player should follow lead suit or trump suit. </p>

<p>Thanks. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Also for the scenerio I mentioned above, isn't J of D lower than Q of D? So shouldn't she play a jack of diamonds? </p></TEXT>

<p>The more I think about it the more confused I become..

So confused... </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Assuming you're talking about Alice's hand for the first trick of euchre_test01.out.correct, you've listed the right cards in her hand. Bob leads the trick with the Ace of Spades. When it's Alice's turn, she looks at what's in her hand and asks, "Do I have any spades?" Since the answer is no, she then needs to choose the lowest card in her hand. That's the Ace of Hearts. Do you understand why?</p>

<p>So going into the second trick she has in her hand</p>
<p>k of d<br />a of d<br />j of d<br />q of d</p>
<p>Bob leads with the King of Spades. Alice still has no spades, so she needs to play the lowest card in her hand. Her hand is now entirely trump. Per the spec, the ordering for trump cards is (from highest to lowest) J (right bower, high), J (left bower), A, K, Q, 10, 9. So the lowest card in Alice's hand is queen of diamonds, and that's what she plays. </p>

<p>If I use my compare card function, I am automatically considering the trump suit.. However, when the led card is King of Spades with Diamonds as the trump suit,</p>

<p>Alice has the following cards in her hand:</p>
<p>Queen of Diamonds</p>
<p>Ace of Hearts</p>
<p>Jack of Diamonds</p>
<p>King of Diamonds</p>

<p>According to the spec, if the player can follow suit, he does so, if not he plays the lowest card in his hand. </p>
<p>Alice has no spades. She therefore plays the lowest card in her hand. Assuming the trump suit is considered, she would play the Ace of Hearts. However, she is supposed to play the Queen of Diamonds.</p>

<p>Therefore, I am wondering if we should disregard the trump suit when considering the "lowest card in the hand."</p></TEXT>

<p>How do you get the card suit in game.cpp for the purpose trying to determine you do declare trump based off of the card face up.  In card, Card_get_suit, requires the trump suit in the function call, but i cant seem to get that.  Thanks in advance.  </p></TEXT>

Card_get_suit is only needed when you need to account for the left bower changing suit. If trump isn't a factor, you just want card.suit.</TEXT>

<p>I just tested your code, and I had to make two changes to get it to compile on CAEN: (1) adding #include &lt;cstring&gt;, and (2) adding a closing curly brace.  Once I did that, it compiled using make euchre and had no problem printing  <code>./euchre pack.in noshuffle 1 Alice Bob Cathy Drew</code> to euchre_test00.out using the command in your original post. </p>
<p>My suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Try adding the #include (though I don't know how you're getting it to compile without that)</p>
<p>2. Run it with gdb. Check all the values you're giving to that big if statement, and make sure they're what you expect.</p>
<p>3. If you still can't fix it, come to office hours.</p>

<p>That was just a code snippet so I actually have enough curly braces but I'll try to add that #include statement to see if that's the problem.

<p>Your player struct shouldn't contain a pack. A player has a name, a hand, and a hand_size.</p>
<p>But your Game struct should contain a pack. You pass Game_play a pointer to a Game, so you can use that to access your pack. You should have a function Pack_deal_one that you can use with the pack to get the first card.</p>

<p>You're talking about the published test cases for the Autograder checkpoint, right? In that case, Pack_deal_one is called in the preceding tests, and that function increments the next pointer in the pack each time it's called. So when Pack_reset is called afterwards, the assert checks that the next pointer has been modified to point back to the original first card in the pack, which is the Nine of Spades. </p></TEXT>

<p>Hi, I have been looking at my code for over an hour now and upon playing the second hand, the player's number of cards does not decrease and they still have the same number and type of cards.  It is not my function for Player_play_card as it passed my tests and the published test cases for Player.cpp.  I am pretty sure it has to do with how I am arranging the players.  I put the 4 players in a 2-star array and arranged that array depending on who is the dealer and/or who took the trick, when appropriate.<br /><br />My code in the game portion is like this:<br />Player_play_card(deal_order_array[3], &amp;led_card, trump_suit)<br /><br />My code in the player_tests portion is like this:<br />Player_play_card(&amp;PlayerOne, &amp;nine_hearts, SPADES);<br /><br />So in the game portion, it is taking in a pointer to a Player instead of a pointer to the address of a Player.  I want to get the memory address of the player its pointing to.  Is that possible?  I tried "&amp;&amp;" which was incorrect and googled around to find the answer with no luck.  We didn't really discuss two-star pointers in the lecture that I can recall either.  Am I just really going in the wrong direction with this?  Please let me know.  I would really appreciate the assistance.  Thank you.</p></TEXT>

If the pack.in doesn't exist when you run the project, what error message should we print?<div><br /></div><div>In pack.cpp it says we should print "open failed."</div><div>But in the spec it says we should print "error opening pack file name"</div></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Printing an error message if pack.in doesn't exist</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe this are two different things. In euchre.cpp you should make sure the file can be opened, if not exit with cout opened fail. The other is an error message while initializing the pack. They are two separate things.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry, I thought i understood this until I saw the instructor's response. The spec says that in euchre.cpp, the only things we check for (regarding the command_line prompts) are that there are 7 arguments and the executable itself, that shuffle option is either "shuffle" or "noshuffle" and points to win game are between 1 and 100. <br /><br />After this, we initialize the game pointer. That means that the only time the error should print regarding the pack is during initializing the pack pointer (which would require both opening and reading the pack). I thought this would be the only place there would be an error.  If that's the case, which error message do we print?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The only error message in the spec. is the one for the Pack_init function. Your Pack_init function should be printing Error opening pack_filename if that pack doesn't exist. So just make sure Pack_init gets called before you print anything else out.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Does that mean you shouldn't even print the general arguments, ie. "./euchre pack.in shuffle Alice Bob Cathy Drew" if pack.in doesn't exist?</p>

<p>So it should JUST print "error opening 'pack_filename' " ?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I wondered that too. Because the spec said to print the command line prompts provided they're correct by the given criteria and THEN initialize game pointer (where pack would be read in), i took it to mean that if pack.in doesn't exist, we would still print general arguments and the error reading pack would be caught later.</p>

<p>This was just my interpretation, though. If anyone can confirm this, that would be great!</p></TEXT>

<p>Maybe I'm missing something, but where are you even seeing the phrase "open failed"? I'm not finding anything about that particular error message anywhere in the spec or in the Pack.h file.</p></TEXT>

<p>I am finding it very difficult to print a player's name when just given a game_ptr? I don't know how to do two pointers for example...</p>

<p>Player player1 = game_ptr-&gt;players[0];</p>
<p>cout &lt;&lt; player1-&gt;name</p>
<p>that didn't work.</p>

<p>I have tried doing a loop and creating a playerNames[4] array, and passing (&amp;game_ptr-&gt;players[i])-&gt;name to playerNames[i]</p>
<p>that didn't work.</p>

<p>I have tried creating a function where you pass into it a player_ptr and then it prints out the name, that didn't work either.</p>

<p>I think it may be a problem with creating new player variables. I am wanting to create new variables like player1, player2, player3 etc etc, so I don't constantly have to write game_ptr-&gt;players[0], but it seems as if these aren't initializing correctly?</p>

<p>Can an instructor please clarify what I should do in regard to writing RMEs in the .cpp file for functions that already have RMEs in the .h file? This was asked in @1295, but not only has there not been an instructor response (which would be preferable for an administrative question like this), but the student responses conflict with one another. Which of the following is correct?</p>

<p>1.) Copy-and-paste the RMEs from the .h file into the .cpp file</p>
<p>2.) Do not write an RME for the functions in the .cpp file which have an RME in the .h file</p>

<p>1) You do not need to copy/paste any of the RMEs. You may do this if you find it helpful to have the RME on hand when writing the implementation.</p>
<p>2) Do not rewrite any RMEs for the functions for which we already provided RMEs.</p>

<p>player_names[i] = new char [MAX_STR_LEN];</p>

So essentially, the dealer would not keep the upcard if it's the lowest among the dealer's other 5 cards.</p></TEXT>

<p>The error is that your function isn't returning anything. That's okay if the function is void, but the compiler is saying the function is not void, and doesn't return anything before it ends. The second error is caused by the first, since your program can't compile, the executable file "euchre" probably doesn't exist.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>did you include Game.h in euchre.cpp?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yup. Believe me, I've checked multiple times, haha. </p>

<p>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</p>

<p>#include &lt;fstream&gt;</p>
<p>#include &lt;cstring&gt;</p>

<p>#include "Card.h"</p>
<p>#include "Pack.h"</p>

<p>Gotcha. I fixed the first error. But I had posted a question about this error earlier in the week:</p>

<p>bash-4.1$ g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror -O1 euchre.cpp Game.cpp Player.cpp Pack.cpp Card.cpp -o euchre<br />/tmp/ccEr4IfR.o: In function `main':<br />euchre.cpp:(.text+0x1c7): undefined reference to `Game_init(Game*, char const*, bool, int, char const* const*)'<br />collect2: ld returned 1 exit status<br />bash-4.1$ </p>

<p>Any ideas?</p></TEXT>

<p>So I was reading through the style guidelines and this question recently popped up that I just want to be absolutely sure:</p>

<p>For the overly "complex functions" (where they suggested &gt;50 lines where we should split our function into parts to make it more readable), does the 50 lines also count comments? </p>

<p>I feel like I'm missing something really obvious, but I can't figure out why I'm getting a segfault.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the code that is causing the segfault is the following code in game_play.</p>
<p>Pack pack2 = game_ptr-&gt;pack;<br /> Card first_card = Pack_deal_one(&amp;pack2);<br /> Card_print(&amp;first_card);</p>

<p>I know this is a problem in game_play because running the same code in game_init does not cause any problems. I suppose it has something to do with the fact that game_ptr is initialized in game_init, while it is passed to game_play, but I have no idea how that causes the code to behave differently in game_play.</p></TEXT>

Do we need to print out the command line in euchre?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yep</p></TEXT>

Yeah, your output should start with the command line arguments, like 
./euchre pack.in shuffle 10 Alice Bob Cathy Drew 
if they are valid, and should use
cout &lt;&lt; "Usage: euchre PACK_FILENAME [shuffle|noshuffle] POINTS_TO_WIN NAME1 NAME2 NAME3 NAME4" &lt;&lt; endl;
if they aren't. You can find more about this in the running the program portion of the spec.</TEXT>

<p>In this scenario where trump is Hearts and led card is clubs and Alice has Queen of Spades, Jack of Spades, Ten of Hearts, Ace of Spades, and King of Spades which card does she play? In my case she played Queen of Spades instead of Jack of Spades, I am not sure why, can someone please explain.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Card scenario</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
I would check to make sure that when deciding which card to play your program is using the correct trump suit and led card suit, and also that it considers all the cards in Alice's hand instead of just sticking with the Queen because it's the first card. It could also be the case that something's wrong with your Card_compare function and it thinks the Queen is lower than the Jack.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
So I'm creating more test output and I had a question. If trump is Hearts, and a player has Jack of Diamonds (left bower), and the led suit is Diamonds, would the player play Jack of Diamonds as their highest card in the led suit or not?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Scenario</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Since the Jack of Diamonds is a left-bower, it is considered a part of the Heart suit. Therefore, no, the player would not play the Jack of Diamonds as the highest card in the led suit because it is not a part of the led suit in this case.</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p><strong>Queen of Clubs led by Bob</strong><br />King of Clubs played by Cathy<br />Queen of Hearts played by Drew<br />Nine of Clubs played by Alice<br />Cathy takes the trick</p>

<p>However, because Clubs is ordered up and Bob is the dealer and the upcard is the Jack of Spades, and Bob's hand consists of the Jack of Clubs, Queen of Clubs, Ace of Diamonds, 9 of Spades, and 10 of spades, shouldn't Bob pick up the Jack of Spades? Isn't it the left bower?</p>

<p>In our project, for certain hands, our Jack's switch suit to the suit of the other color in our euchre_test01.out. If it's supposed to be a Jack of Hearts, it is then a Jack of Diamonds.

What do you return at the end of your main function?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's possible. You might want to run it through gdb just to make sure you aren't returning exit_failure after running the game.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I returned a 0. I am thinking that it could be incorrectly calling an exit(exit_failure). Do you think this could be the case? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>There is an annoucement about correcting the command for testing Player_tests. However, I downloaded the new makefile but the command in it was not updated. Are we supposed to change it? When we submit the final-tar, should we turn in the orginial unchanged makefile on Ctools or the updated one?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Specs Correction: Player_tests compilation command</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think the error was just in the wording of the specs for compiling player_tests.cpp (pack.cpp instead of player.cpp), I used the original makefile and got through the autograder in one piece.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's not a wording issue or typo. I looked into the makefile and  The command used in makefile is in fact having both. Are we supposed to delete pack.cpp in makefile?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm trying to verify that my code works beyond the published test cases, </p>

<p>I think the the easiest way to do so would be to compare the output to someone else's code for a long game.</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Anyone in 1695 want to compare outputs?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
It is an honor code violation to share test cases and output. You can discuss concepts, though.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I pass both euchre tests on my computer, but the autograder says that it fails both euchre tests....anyone have any idea what could possibly cause this?</p></TEXT>

<p>Check to make sure you are printing every argument in argv[ ] with a space after each argument as the first line in your output, just like in in the correct output.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Are you spelling "euchred" wrong perhaps?  (I made that mistake).  Or anything similar?  You should run diff (without the -q argument) as mentioned in the spec to see what exactly is differing between the two files.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah I used a diff site and they are exactly alike. Weird</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Try using kompare? it'll tell you if there are any invisible characters you either have but aren't supposed to, or don't have but are supposed to.</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>My Game.cpp is really long because I decided to do it without any helper functions. I have commented it really nicely so the code is easy to follow, despite being pretty beefy. I was wondering if doing it this way is going to end up costing style points? Or will I still have the chance to get them all if I comment well?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Project 3 Style points</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you end up repeating code a lot, you may be better off just making it into a helper function. It shouldn't take too much time at all, really.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
So, there's a significant chance that you will lose style points (not a hand grader so I don't know for sure), and you definitely will if you repeat code a lot. HOWEVER, in my opinion, the style points aren't a large enough part of the grade to risk breaking it just for style, especially this close to the deadline. This is my personal opinion, and I know a lot of people will disagree. But I tend to be more willing to lose style the closer the deadline gets.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But would points be lost? I don't want to risk messing something up in the process of turning my code into helper functions unless it is worth it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>DO helper functions and add reasonable comments .</p></TEXT>

<p>How do you print out a player's name? I tried</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>Is that a dot (.) before the first bracket? Try getting rid of that so you have the brackets for the array index right after "players".</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hmm...then maybe you're trying to access off the end of the array, or trying to print the players' names before you've initialized them?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry that was just a typo</p></TEXT>

The autograder doesn't look at your actual project folder. It just knows what you submit in the tar file. As long as the tar file is correct, the autograder won't fail (unless of course you have a bug in your code)</TEXT>

<p>I removed the q from the diff command which I copied and pasted from the makefile and it still didn't do what I wanted</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
probably asked many times</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
If there is no difference, then diff won't output anything. Also, are you typing the diff command on a separate line? A lot of students have been typing it on the same line as the line where they run euchre.</TEXT>

<p>When I make my final submission file, it outputs in terminal all the files in it (including Card.cpp) but when I submit it to the autograder, i get this error:</p>

<p>I honestly have no idea where this error is coming from.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Error with autograder</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Try untarring the file and see what happens.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>We had the same problem when turning it into the autograder, but we realized that the autograder defaults to Project 2 since that's the last thing we turned in so we accidentally sent in the final tar for Project 2 so it couldn't find Card. cpp. Make sure when you are submitting, that you go to the Project 3 folder and submit the final tar.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>If we make a custom stacked deck to test pack.cpp, will it still be able to pass the autograder? I'm just concerned because the makefile does not compile our packs so it might fail the assert functions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Making a Custom Pack</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
The test cases you give us are graded based on compilation and hand grading. You can specify whatever pack you want. as long as it would make sense to a hand grader that you're testing all the functions and as long as everything compiles, you're good.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Say for example a team euchres the other team by taking all 5 tricks. This is just supposed to be considered a euchre, not a march right? From my understanding our program should never print both "march!" and "euchre!". I just need clarification on this because the spec was a little unclear about this.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
march! compared to euchre!</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>march! is when the side that ordered up the trump gets 5 tricks. euchred! is when the side that didn't order up the trump gets 3-5 tricks. So if Alice orders up the trump, than a march! occurs when Alice and Cathy get 5 points, while a euchre! occurs if Bob and Drew get 3-5 tricks.</p>

<p>And yes, it is not possible for both of these to happen at the same time, so there should never be a march! and euchred! in the same hand.</p></TEXT>

It means you have a bug in your code. Run it through GDB to find it (make sure you're compiling with the -g flag)</TEXT>

Output question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Yes, it's in the spec somewhere</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Yes</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Do we output the error message starting with "Usage: " first or do we always start with outputting the command line?</p>

<p>What I'm asking is, if our command line isn't properly entered, will the output be:</p>

<p>Usage: ........     first</p>

<p>or will it be:</p>

<p>./euchre wrong_format</p>
<p>Usage: ......</p>


<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Order of Error Output</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The spec says that the main function in euchre.cpp "should read the command line arguments, check them for errors, and then print them." So if I'm reading it correctly, first check for errors in the command line arguments - if you find any, print the error message and exit. Else, go on to printing the command line arguments.</p></TEXT>

<p>Are we allowed to compare outputs with other people that use the same pack as us? I am just trying to test my program when doing stress test cases because it will be hard to play 50 points game of euchre by hand with cards. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The spec says, "Use euchre.cpp to perform system tests on your Game." I know that when we run euchre.cpp, it will check that parts of our command line have the right input. However, if we're testing individual functions (aka, we don't check if the inputs are good through euchre.cpp), such as Game_init() and Game_play(), isn't it possible to have a game that goes up to 1000000 points. Or worse, -100000 points? Or fewer than 4 players? Or all these other weird cases. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Testing Individual Functions</TEXT>

<p>That won't be the case. Tests for individual functions are called with correct inputs.</p></TEXT>

<p>Anyone ever have this problem?  Does anyone know why?<br /><br />I am using the debugger and breakpoints in XCode and before the array is passed into the function, everything is fine, but then, once the array is passed into the function, it only shows the first three elements of that array even though the function utilized all four elements.  To be exact, it shows the name of the array, which I can then click the arrow to see the first element, and then it shows element [1] and [2].  (This is a 4-element array.)<br /><br />I do indeed have a 4-element array and all my code works so far (passing test cases).  I just wanted to go back and do some more tests and wanted to be able to look at what cards each player has when doing the tests.<br /><br />Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks!</p></TEXT>

<p>Having a strange problem with player_play_card. It's choosing the wrong card for one of the players in game.cpp (and subsequently messing up the rest of the output). So I thought it might be a problem with the function itself so i made a new test program, created a player with a hand identical to the one in the test case, and ran it, and got the right card. It's only choosing the wrong card in game.cpp. I made sure all the arguments are right and that the hand in game.cpp is right. I have no idea why this is happening. Any help would be greatly appreciated</p></TEXT>

<p>Since the bug could be in various different places, this would be a good question for office hours (which are still going on in 1695 BBB). However, here are some things you should try on your own:</p>

<p>1) Run through valgrind, make sure you have no errors</p>

<p>2) Run through GDB, and find the EXACT parameters being sent in to the function (this will probably unveil the bug, but use valgrind first since its' easier!)</p></TEXT>

<p>Does suit hierarchy change depending on the trump suit? i.e. is the original order is Diamonds &gt; Clubs &gt; Hearts &gt; Spades, if the trump suit is Hearts does the hierarchy change to: Hearts &gt; Spades &gt; Diamonds &gt; Clubs?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Suit Hierarchy</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If the trump suit is Hearts, then the new suit hierarchy becomes Hearts &gt; Diamonds &gt; Clubs &gt; Spades, with all Hearts being more valuable than the other cards in order of right bower, left bower, then rank order starting from Ace. So we keep the original ordering of suits, except for the trump suit, which we move to the top. (This is not taking lead suit into account, only trump).</p></TEXT>

did you modify the .h files at all? if so that's your problem. make sure that you make all helper functions you write static functions in the .cpp files and DO NOT PUT THOSE IN THE .h files.

<p>Thanks for your suggestion, Jawad. Valgrind didn't find any memory problems with my "euchre" object file.</p>

<p>I think I saw your post earlier about how "euchre.h" doesn't exist, and hence shouldn't be included --- is that what you mean here?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Exactly! euchre.h doesn't exist... it wasn't required for submission. Thus when we submitted it through linux/vnc/mac it worked, because we had our own .h file. But since it wasn't required for the autograder and was included in our .cpp file it caused a compiler error </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>By the way, sorry I don't have something more definitive for you, but your exact error had to be something related to euchre or Game, if the autograder didn't yell at you for anything else. Hope that narrows things down, if you're looking at this. Hopefully replacing the .h files works!</p></TEXT>

<p>Thanks for your response!</p>

<p>Yeah, all my student-defined functions are static functions in my .cpp's.</p>
<p>I've redownloaded all four .h files, and submitted my 4th time (I believe the only differences between my old .h's and the new ones were the comments at the top displaying me and my partner's uniqnames)</p>

<p>I don't know werther it worked, since I've exceeded my submission limit for feedback.</p>
<p>Keeping my fingers crossed...</p></TEXT>

<p>Will test cases be graded on quantity? Or will having a reasonable number of quality tests be enough?</p></TEXT>

<p>Will test cases be graded on the basis of having a certain number of them? Or will having a reasonable number of quality tests be enough? I feel like my tests are pretty comprehensive, but the files themselves don't look too long for Card and Pack.</p></TEXT>

<p>You only need to test each function you write once (except for static in which case you don't technically have to write any).</p>

<p>But you will want to write more. </p></TEXT>

<p>The following code works as intended on my laptop running windows, but it is not running as intended on CAEN Linux:</p>

<p>        cout &lt;&lt; "Highest is initially ";<br />        Card_print(highest);<br />        cout &lt;&lt; ", address is " &lt;&lt; highest &lt;&lt;endl; <br />        Card played = Player_play_card(player_ptr, lead_ptr, trump);<br />        cout &lt;&lt; "Highest is now ";<br />        Card_print(highest);<br />        cout &lt;&lt; ", address is " &lt;&lt; highest &lt;&lt;endl; <br />        Card_print(&amp;played); <br />        cout &lt;&lt; " played by " &lt;&lt; player_ptr-&gt;name &lt;&lt; " address is " &lt;&lt; &amp;played &lt;&lt; endl;</p>

<p>highest is supposed to point to the highest card currently played in the trick, while played is supposed to be the card that has been played by the player. On CAEN Linux however, highest ends up pointing to played (highest and %played display the same address), so the highest is constantly equal to the card played.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no idea what is going on here. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Edit: Here is the output from valgrind. There are no line numbers provided, but there seem to be a lot of "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)" errors.</p>

<p>Edit2: I went back and made sure all my pointers were initialized per Jay's suggestion, still having the same issue.</p>

<p>Edit3: The program does seem to work as intended as long as the -O1 flag isn't used.</p>

Differing Behavior between Windows and Linux</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The following code works as intended on my laptop running windows, but it is not running as intended on CAEN Linux:</p>

<p>        cout &lt;&lt; "Highest is initially ";<br />        Card_print(highest);<br />        cout &lt;&lt; ", address is " &lt;&lt; highest &lt;&lt;endl; <br />        Card played = Player_play_card(player_ptr, lead_ptr, trump);<br />        cout &lt;&lt; "Highest is now ";<br />        Card_print(highest);<br />        cout &lt;&lt; ", address is " &lt;&lt; highest &lt;&lt;endl; <br />        Card_print(&amp;played); <br />        cout &lt;&lt; " played by " &lt;&lt; player_ptr-&gt;name &lt;&lt; " address is " &lt;&lt; &amp;played &lt;&lt; endl;</p>

<p>highest is supposed to point to the highest card currently played in the trick, while played is supposed to be the card that has been played by the player. On CAEN Linux however, highest ends up pointing to played (highest and %played display the same address), so the highest is constantly equal to the card played.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no idea what is going on here. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Edit: Here is the output from valgrind. There are no line numbers provided, but there seem to be a lot of "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)" errors.</p>

<p>Edit2: I went back and made sure all my pointers were initialized, still having the same issue.</p>

Differing Behavior between Windows and Linux</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The following code works as intended on my laptop running windows, but it is not running as intended on CAEN Linux:</p>

<p>        cout &lt;&lt; "Highest is initially ";<br />        Card_print(highest);<br />        cout &lt;&lt; ", address is " &lt;&lt; highest &lt;&lt;endl; <br />        Card played = Player_play_card(player_ptr, lead_ptr, trump);<br />        cout &lt;&lt; "Highest is now ";<br />        Card_print(highest);<br />        cout &lt;&lt; ", address is " &lt;&lt; highest &lt;&lt;endl; <br />        Card_print(&amp;played); <br />        cout &lt;&lt; " played by " &lt;&lt; player_ptr-&gt;name &lt;&lt; " address is " &lt;&lt; &amp;played &lt;&lt; endl;</p>

<p>highest is supposed to point to the highest card currently played in the trick, while played is supposed to be the card that has been played by the player. On CAEN Linux however, highest ends up pointing to played (highest and %played display the same address), so the highest is constantly equal to the card played.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no idea what is going on here. Any help would be appreciated.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Differing Behavior between Windows and Linux</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
sounds like you are trying to do stuff with uninitialized pointers, make sure that everywhere in your code when you declare a pointer you also make it point somewhere in your code or make it point to NULL</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you compile your executable with the -g flag, and run valgrind again, it will tell you which lines in particular are giving you problems.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hmm, so all of the lines where it said there were errors had game_ptr. Since game_ptr is a parameter passed into functions, I didn't think I would have to initialize it. Do I have to do somthing like</p>

<p>Game *ptr = game_ptr;</p>

<p>or is there another issue at hand?</p>

<p>Edit: Tried doing that, didn't work. So it definitely is something else...</p>

<p>By the way, compiling the program with just the -g flag does make it work as intended. In fact, it appears to work as intended as long as the -O1 flag isn't used.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Are you making sure everything in game_init is working correctly?</p>

<p>Also, there is one line of valgrind that is different from the others...</p>

<p>"Use of uninitialised value of size 8" </p>

<p>Look especially here. This may be where the problem is initiating, then later propagates through the rest of the program.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>"Edit3: The program does seem to work as intended as long as the -O1 flag isn't used."</p>

<p>Your program should work no matter which flag is being used. Actually, this is a pretty good sign it's a memory problem.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So if that one line of valgrind refers to this line of code, the signature for the main funtion:</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {</p>

<p>Then what does that mean? Should I be iterating through each element of argv[] to get what I need or is it ok to just pluck directly from specific indices of argv?</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As long as you are accessing legal indices within the array, you should be fine</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So does</p>

<p>not necessarily mean there's a problem with euchre?</p>

<p>Also, none of the lines pointed out by valgrind seem to have any relation to the portion of code that I originally inquired about. They all seem to have to do with keeping track of the score instead.</p>

<p>For reference, the part of the code that initializes my scores array is this:</p>
<p>    int scores[NUM_PARTNERSHIPS]; <br />    for (int i = 0; i &lt; NUM_PARTNERSHIPS; ++i) { <br />        scores[i] = 0; <br />    } <br />    memcpy(game_ptr-&gt;score, scores, NUM_PARTNERSHIPS);</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Most likely, it is a bug somewhere in euchre. Are you passing in the right amount of parameters? Are you calling on invalid indices in your program? These are a few possibilities leading to this problem</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I do not believe that is the case. I copied the command line given in the specs when running the program, so the number of parameters should be correct. In addition, I do not go past argv[4], so I don't think I'm calling on invalid indices in the program. In addition, the program worked fine on my laptop.</p>

<p>Also, did you see the edit to my post about about my scores array?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Just saw the edit now. That seems strange.</p>

<p>So right now, your best bet might be to just run through this with gdb (or any other debugger) and see if you can find anything, since this bug could be in various different locations within your code. At least, this is what I would do.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks for all the help and speedy replies. In the end, I was able to find a workaround, but it will probably involve a few style points being taken off. I am still quite perplexed by what was wrong with my original program though. I will definitely come back to this later and run it through gdb.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>After making sure to initialize all of my pointers, the program still behaves the same, and there are still just as many valgrind errors. :(</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Card_print works fine during the first trick, but when it goes through the next time I can't print any cards for some reason. I am assigning each one a new value based on the cards that need to be played in the second trick and then when i try to print the cards it doesn't work.</p></TEXT>

<p>if you are talking about the first line in the output that euchre.cpp generates then you will probably not pass any of the full euchre test cases because the first line is different than the expected output. The autograder essentially does a diff between your programs output and the expected output so if there is one difference then you fail that test case.</p></TEXT>

Seg faults were pretty much the bane of my (and I'm sure the TA's) existence.  That being said, poor time management left me unable to practice test-driven development, and it seems like that could've really helped to avoid a lot of those seg faults.  For Project 4, I'm going to really try to get a start in adopting test-driven development but are there any tips out there to avoid these critters?  Do ADT's welcome some new kind of common error?</TEXT>

<p>3. Writing code isn't like writing an essay, where you try to do the whole draft before you proofread what you've got.  Compile and test after you write each little piece of your program. It's so much easier to find an error if you know it worked just fine before you wrote for-loop X and everything stopped working when you added for-loop X. </p>
<p>4. Understand why you're using a pointer and what you expect it to point to. When I started learning C++, any time I had a pointer problem, I randomly threw *s and &amp;s at everything until the compiler stopped complaining, and then wondered why I got segfaults all over the place. A much better approach is to step back as soon as something isn't compiling or behaving the way you expect and describe in words or pictures what's happening with memory.</p>

<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>This is far from a complete list, and I encourage others (both students and instructors) to add more.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This, a million times. Saved me from a lot of the search part of debugging, which is a huge time killer.<br /><br />If you know a program should never act a certain way [ie, in Player's play card function, if there's a chance that the card or its index you're about to return hasn't changed or is incorrect, assert that its correct], then feel free to add asserts.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
thanks for the tips ya'll</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>One thing I found really helpful was to go overboard on the asserts until I got more confident with pointers. Even if adding tons of asserts seems overkill, I've found that it's much more helpful for a program to gracefully crash (and tell you exactly which line it crashed on) than it is to get a confusing or vague error message. Plus, the more specific you make your asserts, the easier it'll be to understand what went wrong. </p>

<p>And you can always take out the asserts later if your code looks too messy (or maybe that's just me!)</p></TEXT>

<p>I did not code the project using TDD methodology. I just did not think that it was complicated enough to approach with such precaution. I did not get a single segmentation fault during program development. My approach was PAD, which I just named. Whenever possible I recommend the method to fellow students. PAD, stands for Paper Assisted Development. In PAD methodology you approach the problem not just with a computer but also a pen and paper as well. Prof's tests are a great helper as well. So it goes like this:</p>

<p>1. Keep a pen and paper next to you, as you read the function requirements if there is anything you are unsure take note, I also occasionally write down imaginary cases. Before starting to write function convince yourself that you understand it.</p>

<p>2. Write the function.</p>

<p>3. If something goes wrong hypothesize where it might have gone wrong, use prints to see values up to that point and add a break point after print values so you can see whether the output is as expected up to that point.</p>

<p>4. Repeat 3 until you find the error in your function. Then fix it.</p>

<p>5. Apply 1-4 until the project is done.</p>

<p>6. Run tests supplied, write your own test.</p>

<p>Of course PAD is not alternative to TDD in reality, in projects so far it was for me but for larger projects it's not near enough. Still I think it's a great compliment to TDD (or any other methodology really), my thesis is that no matter how smart you are, there is too much to track and think as you develop. I think human memory works in a way like computer memory. Just like the way the computer hold a piece of memory until it's released, we tend to keep bits of information or details until we stop thinking that we will need them. If you are writing functions and getting odd results, and not understanding the cause immediately, erroneous results start stacking up on your memory, if this goes on for so long you will eventually be unable to separate correct and incorrect, because you've run out memory required to think clearly (this is called stack overflow). Having a pen and paper and using them to help programming does not solve the problem ultimately (if you can't solve the issue soon enough, you will face paper overflow) however, it supplies great relief and adds significant extension to the time you can think clearly. </p>

<p>This is the most useful advice I could give. I think the reason I didn't get seg faults is because of PAD (understanding that pointers are just tools for redirection also helps). Who knows, maybe when you get very good you don't need PAD even as a complement to TDD, but until then at least I will stick with it.</p>

<p>-----</p>
<p>[I personally use the above general method- I always say never, EVER just start coding. Look at the specs, understand it, and then write a list of what's necessary and such. Most bugs, in my opinion, are caused by two things: 1) Not understanding the task at hand entirely, in steps and 2) Losing yourself in your current piece of code without understanding how it works with the entire system as you're working on it]</p></TEXT>

<p>Of course starting early is easier said than done. But whenever you say "I can wait until tomorrow", think again. Code maybe 1 or 2 functions a day and you won't be as stressed towards the end. If you wait until the last minute and start panicking, your panicking <strong>can</strong> actually affect your coding accuracy.</p>

<p>And then yeah, "thinking about it" doesn't work as well with coding as compared to maybe writing a paper. Planning something out and then waiting until the last few days to actually do the coding itself can only get you into trouble. You may think that you can do something this way and when you try to turn it into code, you will very likely see that it is easier said than done.</p></TEXT>

Lab 07 Question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the original code, find the line that says <code>Ellipse* shapes[NUM_SHAPES] = {&amp;e1};</code> </p>
<p>Change that line so that, instead of creating an array of pointers to Ellipses, it creates an array of pointers to Shapes. (Think about how you know what type the array is, and change that piece of the line.) It's okay to still have a pointer to the Ellipse e1 in the array of Shapes, because any Ellipse IS A Shape. In the same way, it'll be okay to have a pointer to a Circle you create in that array, because a Circle IS A Shape.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe it literally means to replace "Ellipse*" with "Shape*" so that it is now an array of size shapesarray that points to type Shape rather than Ellipse. This way, elements in the array can also point to type Rectangle when you do task 2 since the array points to the type of the abstract base class.</p></TEXT>

This way you can also point to type Rectangle when you do task 2 since the array points to the type of the abstract base class.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You also have to add an element (another pointer) to the shapes array so that's also pointing to the circle you just created, since the program will go through the elements that are in shapes to print. Otherwise, circle doesn't get accounted for when it's printing and it will just print the ellipse that's already in there.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I had already done that and it still didnt print :(</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hmm. I would also double check that your circle is being correctly initialized as an instance of ellipse (printing the area might help). When I wasn't able to print circle, I wasn't getting compile errors but I also found that circle wasn't properly initialized.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>to get the area wouldnt i do c1.area()?</p>

<p>I tried that and it didnt work :/</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yup, that's how you would get the area and then you would cout the return value from calling that member function. I would re-look at how you're initializing the circle such that it's an instance of ellipse. You can use the constructor for ellipse to do this.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I did just that…i used the ellipse's constructor and it still wont work :(</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>i tried modifying it but it still only prints the ellipse...i dont know what im doing wrong...</p>
<p>i changed the size of the array to 2 and then changed the line that says <code>Ellipse* shapes[NUM_SHAPES] = {&amp;e1};</code>  to be of type Shapes...and then i changed the for loops first part to just have Shapes **s rather than Ellipse **s and it doesnt work :(</p>

<p>what am i doing wrong? please help!</p>

<p>thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the lab spec it says: </p>
<p>"You should be able to write Circle without declaring any new private member variables...", but because xRad and yRad are private in Ellipse and derived classes don't inherit private members how is this possible? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Lab 7</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Since Circle inherits from Ellipse (Circle <em>is an</em> Ellipse), Circle has access to Ellipse's public member functions. That said, you can use those member functions to implement Circle. For example, the Circle constructor can reuse the constructor from Ellipse to set its radius using an initializer list. Lecture 11 (Subtypes) has some really good examples which directly apply to this lab.</p>

<p>Hopefully that helps!</p></TEXT>

<p>circle DOES inherit the private member variables of it's parent class ellipse it's just that circle objects don't have direct access to the private data but that is what "getter" functions in ellipse are for</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>True, but Circle doesn't need to access the xRad and yRad variables. The only thing it needs to do is ensure that when you construct a circle with a single radius, that radius gets passed to the Ellipse constructor for both xRad_in and yRad_in.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I could be wrong but it looks like Ellipse does not have getter and setter functions. It inherits position set/getting functions but does not have any that deal with xRad and yRad.  </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Never mind.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can, it's just a matter of syntax.  The Ellipse(rad_in, rad_in) part goes in the same place as would an initializer list.</p></TEXT>

<p>Did you override the print function for rectangle?</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>It is more efficient to do so as you can avoid writing any circle function implementations at all. Just make sure to make your circle inherit from Ellipse.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
If you declare Circle as a subclass of Ellipse, it'll have its own constructor (since circles need to be able to be made from just one double), but from then on it can just be seen as a special case of an Ellipse, and so use its functions instead of overwriting with its own.</TEXT>

<p>any ideas why?</p>

<p>I would recommend checking if the statements you used to write the draw function are ever actually false, because it seems that they never are...</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>any ideas why?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Yeah, it looks like you have a draw function that's too inclusive of which pixels are within the shape. You could just draw one of the shapes at a time if you're having trouble figuring out which it is, and then debug that one.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>    // Note: if shuffle is called on a deck that has already had some<br />    // cards dealt, those cards should first be restored to the deck<br />    // in the order in which they were dealt, preserving the most<br />    // recent post-shuffled/post-reset state.<br />    // This function produces no output.</p>

<p>Just so I am certain, does this mean that all the cards that were dealt from the deck should return to the bottom of the deck in the same order they were dealt?</p>

<p>For example, if the first two cards of an unshuffled deck were dealt (2,3 of spades), would the last four cards of a deck before it was shuffled be [...,K-diamond, A-diamond, 2-spade, 3-spade]?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Using Deck::Shuffle</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>To be honest, I see the ambiguity now that you show your interpretation. The way I interpreted was that the cards that had been dealt must be returned to the front of the deck so that it is if the deck was not used at all. I think this is the correct interpretation, judging from their statement about preserving the most recent "post-shuffled/post-reset" state.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The key there is "preserving the most recent post-shuffled/post-reset state." They should be returned such that after they are returned, the deck should be in the state that it was in before you dealt the cards. Note, there is a way to do this so that you don't have to actually move cards into and out of the deck. Think about how you "dealt" cards for project 3.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'd imagine that there would be different ways to represent a player (because we have several "is a" relationships), and some of those ways would be correct and some incorrect. So should our tests should be testing for both good and bad ADT implementations/representation invariants?</p></TEXT>

<p>In your last implementation, I can't find anything wrong about it. I actually used a similar line in my own implementation.

 <TEXT>
<p>1. In the implementation of Deck's member function deal(), there's an issue of "going off" the end of the cards[] array. In deal(), even though the requires clause states that the deck cannot be empty (so the function will always return a valid card), what happens when I return the last card in the array at index 51? With a "newly opened" deck, if I've dealt all the previous 51 cards and I call deal() once more, the Card returned would be the Ace of Diamonds. However, the *next pointer would then have to increment one past cards[51], which is not a valid address in the array. How should I handle this? Is it okay to leave it be, considering that the requires clause enforces the *next pointer actually pointing to a valid index in the cards[] array and so deal() would never be called in this situation?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Deck's member function cards_remaining() has a similar issue. In order to return the correct number of cards, I must add 52 to cards (where cards is just the pointer to the first element in the array). However, adding 52 would give an address that is one past the end of the array. Is this okay, considering that my implementation returns the correct number anyway?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. How are we to determine, for every situtation, which value -- 1 or 11 -- of the ace is more advantageous for the player? I realize that if the player's hand value is 10 and an ace is recieved, then it should take the value of 11; and if the hand value is greater than 10, then 1 should be chosen. But what of hand values less than 10? And what about if they are dealt two aces? Should one ace be 11 and the other be 1, or both of them are 1? A problem am I having is that Hand does not keep track of which cards are in the hand, only the total value. How can we decide which value of the ace is more advantageous if we do not know what future cards will be dealt?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As an illustration of this, let's say the player is dealt a 7 and an ace. Then the player's hand value could be either 18 or 8. Which value the ace takes depends on future cards -- if the player receives a King, then the ace taking the value of 1 would clearly be more advantageous; but if the player received a 3, then the ace should take the value of 11. But Hand does not keep track of individual cards, only the total! If the ace is received, then we must decide the value of the ace then and there. How can we decide if it would be better for it to be 1 or 11?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
A few questions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>1) The deck should be reshuffled after it reaches a certain minimum. So, that situation shouldn't happen.</p>
<p>2) It's alright as long as you never dereference that address.</p>
<p>3) You may find it useful to calculate the current state of the hand inside Hand::add_card(). That's where the interesting stuff happens. It can be done in a way that doesn't depend on future cards.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is it expected to implement the reshuffle in Deck.cpp once it reaches a certain minimum? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I am not understanding the reasoning on why should we put a const after a getter function such like this: get_a() const;</p>
<p>. The function isn't modifying the 'a' member variable in any way, it is just returning it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
const after getter functions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That is actually why the const is there. The const tells the compiler that you will not be modifying any of the member variables when executing that member function, which you shouldn't be for any such getter functions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah. Its almost like the same implementation that we saw before for const. Instead of just keeping it const in your code, you now have the compiler there to yell at you if you by accident happen to change it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is it like a safer way to make sure that any member variables are not getting modified at all?</p></TEXT>

<pre>class Isosceles : public Triangle {
public:
//EFFECTS: sets base (edge a)
void set_base(double base) {
a = base; //compile error
}
//EFFECTS: sets legs (edges b and c)
void set_leg(double leg) {
b = c = leg; //compile error
}
};</pre>
<p>I am a little confused on why can't Isosceles access the member variables just like how Triangle can.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Can't access member variables</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Remember that a, b, and c are private data members of Triangle, so Triangle member functions are allowed to directly access those private data members. However, Isosceles is a derived class of Triangle, and while derived classes do inherit member data/functions, they're not allowed to directly access the private members of the base class. So Isosceles <em>is a</em> Triangle and thus still has an a, b, and c like any other Triangle - but it can't directly access a, b, and c, which is what the public "getter" and "setter" functions in the base class are for.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The only way a derived class can directly access its base class' member variables is if those members are either public or protected. I vaguely remember Professor DeOrio saying that he wasn't a fan of using protected data members though. Don't quote me on that though haha.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Quote her. I believe she is correct in that assertion.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So basically the only way to access the member variables directly is if they are public instead of private?</p></TEXT>

<p>The only thing you can put in a constructor before the curly braces is the initialization list. All other code must go in the curly braces.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>There's probably some examples of it, but in general, a constructor that isn't using a initialization list should look pretty similar to and will use curly braces more like any other function. One of the syntax differences will be that it doesn't show a return type, and is just Deck::Deck() instead. You're getting your errors because it's trying to initialize variables and run statements in for loops without it actually being inside the constructor.<br /><br />So you could use<br /><br />Deck::Deck(){<br />    // do constructor things here<br />}</p></TEXT>

So now I am stuck between a rock and a hard place with the only seemingly way to be added abstractions in the .h file for my derived classes, but the spec clearly states not changing the .h files so... I am stuck...</p></TEXT>

What to #include in our player tests</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So if I understand your question correctly you're not able to get your Player_tests to recognize your derived Simple/Counting/Competitor classes? I think the way to go about this is to use the return value of the factory function. In the Player.cpp file, you should have three static global instances - one for each type of Player. The factory function you implement in the Player.cpp file will return a pointer to the specified Player based on what c-string is passed in as a parameter to the function. Then, in the test case, you can declare a pointer to Player and assign it the return value of the factory function, which will then give you the correct subtype of Player depending on what c-string is passed into the function. Polymorphism!!</p>

<p>Hopefully that helps.</p></TEXT>

get_rank()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Remember that this function is a "getter" function to return a Card's private member variable (rank) through a public method. So you really only need to return the rank (the actual enum value) of the Card object upon which you call the function.</p>

<p>If I understand your question, are you maybe trying to return an actual string value for the rank instead? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Maybe check that the function is in the scope of the Card class via the scope resolution operator.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Your get_rank() function is missing the resolution operator for Card (ie. Card::get_rank()) and so the compiler doesn't know where the "rank" variable is coming from. When you add the "Card::" part, the compiler will be able to verify that rank is a private member variable of Card. </p></TEXT>

<p>Oh, really? Yes, please. Clarification would be great!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>(See instructor response above for latest info.)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm still a bit confused by your wording. By "original ordering" in the instructor post do you mean "newly opened" order or the order the deck was in before any cards were dealt.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Newly opened.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>okay so what's the final verdict on this?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The descriptions in the .h files and the spec are correct. Both reset and the constructor result in the cards being ordered as if they were a "newly opened" deck of cards. (As well as setting the next pointer to the beginning to ensure dealing cards starts at the right place.)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>thank you!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So is reset() supposed to change the order of the Deck so it's back to the newly opened order (ie. Two of Spades, Three of Spades....Ace of Diamonds)? </p>

<p>Or is it just supposed to set the next pointer back to the first card in the deck, whatever that card may be?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>reset should be written as described in the spec. It returns the Deck to the original ordering as well as changing the next pointer.</p>

<p>(This response was written after the others in these threads and contains the most recent/updated information.)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My partner and I were wondering if you call the shuffle function in Deck with 0 as the input would the cards remain in the same order or be reversed? (A new deck starts with 2 of spades, we were writing a test case about shuffling with 0 as input and we thought deck might be reversed)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Questions about Deck and shuffle</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It would be the same. As in the spec, the first 0 cards would go into the left array and the last 52 cards would go into the right. You would alternate cards from the front of each, starting with right. If either of them becomes empty, fill in with the rest of the cards in the opposite array in the order they are found there. In your case, left is empty right away, so fill with the right array and you have what you started with.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe so.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So the first card would still be 2 of spades?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>can't*</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How would we check if the array element is empty? We can just do == 0 or == \n right?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Do we need to write test cases that will violate the requires clause.</p>
<p>For example should we test for shuffle(100) or is this not needed? Also, if we do need to test for this what would the output need to be?</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
test cases</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think we are to assume that the REQUIRES clause is upheld in their buggy ADT's. Instructor correct me if i'm wrong!</p>

<p>I am still a little confused on what filter wants.</p>

<p>If we call filter(3) for instance, does that mean the array should only contain 3's or 3 elements total?</p>

<p>And does that mean we loop through the array in main or loop in filter?</p>

<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Lab08 Task 4 filter</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Filter loops through the array and only copies the variables into the new array that return a true in accordance to the function given into the filter function. That's why the one parameter for filter is a function, not an int.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hello. I am having a problem initializing the cards in the deck. Since I am not able to access the member variables of a specific card, I do not know how to change the rank and suit. Furthermore, the overloaded constructor cannot be used to initialize the values of the cards. Any tips to get me thinking?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Stuck on Deck() constructor</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I initialized each card one by one.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can use a loop with the overloaded constructor. Remember that enums are integers "under the hood", so a loop variable can be cast to its enum counterpart. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks. This is actually an idea I was looking at. The problem, I think, is that when a Card is initialized within the loop, say to the Two of Spades, then it is overwritten on the next iteration of the loop, say to the Three of Spades. Now cards[0] and cards[1] are both pointing to the Three of Spades, which is obviously not correct.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>#tara2014</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>What do you mean by Card being initialized to Two of Spades, then to Three of Spades. Why would this happen? #anon2014 #taha2014 #tara2014 #piazza==Twitter?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm actually impressed someone had the tenacity to initialize each of the 52 cards one by one</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Impressed or surprised? I guess that such an amount of tenacity is impressive, though.</p>
<p>Actually, it might run more quickly because that type of initialization is always constant, so the compiler might always do it more quickly than with a for loop. Not sure, though.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
doing the loop is the way to go
and if there is any increase in efficiency from declaring all 52 cards by hand it's negligible</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would prefer not to use that approach, since it will require high amounts of repeated code. There has to be a better solution. I can think of one way using dynamic memory, but, alas, this is essentially forbidden.</p>

<p>Any other tips?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you are writing a member function which means that you are inside the Deck class so you have access to the member variables of the Deck class, you don't need access to Card member variables you just need to make the 52 different cards and throw them in the array</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm having the same problem where I'm not sure how to initialize the cards in the constructor because I can't access private member variables. Any suggestions on how to go about doing this?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is there anyway to use a for loop inside a constructor? or do we have to initialize all 52 cards?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Deck constructor</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can definitely use a for loop. Remember that an enum is an integer "under the hood", so you can cast a loop variable's value to its enum counterpart. So say I have int i = 0 in my loop, then I can cast that to a Card::Rank - namely, Card::TWO. Hopefully that gives you some ideas!</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Anyone know how to solve this? I've had this issue in the past<img src="https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/hyrdt7uykox4mt/hq5yd7azafs6p3/i247aq2r2wzh/Screen_Shot_20141104_at_11.43.00_PM.png" /></p></TEXT>

linker error on Xcode</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>do you have a main function defined?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you want your program to do anything it needs a main, that's where the program starts (it's also called an "entry point"). I imagine you could compile some sort of DLL (dynamic linked library) that wouldn't have a main, but I don't think that's what we're doing for this project.</p>

<p>Another term for your main function is the "driver", because it "drives" your program. It's described on the fourth page of the project spec, and should be in a file named blackjack.cpp</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That fixed the part about the main, but the other errors still stand, any ideas?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Are you including your Card.h in Deck.cpp?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>also: I just checked and you can compile without linking using the -c flag in g++. Essentially what this does is tell g++ not to link the object files it generates into an actual program, so you won't need a main (the spec mentions it briefly on page 9).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah I was, I think I'll just use Xcode as an editor, then run it in the terminal, thanks for the help.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>what do you mean? I thought we don't need a main?</p></TEXT>

I am also aware of the partner policy, and how we're unable to work with someone who's taking the course for the first time.

<p>I was thinking this morning at how after we submit our projects to the final autograder that that's the rest that we do with the project.</p>

<p>I thought that maybe a good idea of what the staff could do to foster a better learning experience would be for the final autograder, and only the final autograder, we could receive the input and/or the output our program put out compared to the correct output. Giving this to students would allow them to reflect on what went wrong in their program and why/how.</p>

<p>Another thing this could really help with is the idea of implement, test, re-implement/improve. Given a certain period of time after we were given the final results from the autograder we could fix our programs and resubmit them for additional credit with only regards to the autograder score and not style. This would cause students to have to re-look at their programs and to also have left sufficient comments for themselves so that they would be able to once again easily pickup the project again and fix it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how easy this idea would be, but I think that it would be worth looking into. I think that these days school is only about the last turn in and not reflecting over what went wrong and how to fix it. Hopefully staff and students agree with me that this would be a useful learning experience.</p></TEXT>

<p>you can still reflect without anything new implemented in the curriculum. just go to office hours for feedback.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So instead of giving the outputs, why not just show the results from the final testing suite used for grading? That way both the problems would be fixed. Or at least, have extensive test suites just for the autograder which would test similar things tested in the final grading test suites</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
we are trying to get you to think about testing more which is why we only publish a very small amount of test cases. in the real world and even in later classes you won't have other people there to help you with testing so it's good to develop those skills early and practice often
when I took this class we didn't get any feedback at all from the autograder, you didn't even know if your code compiled or not</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Also, when Jay took this class I was a first term GSI and had no clue what I was doing. He had it pretty rough.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>One of the reasons we can't do this sort of thing is that the test cases are reused between terms. If we give final feedback that indicates what the input to the program is, we would have to develop new test cases for each term.</p>

<p>As mentioned in a follow-up above, an option for individual feedback is to go to office hours. While staff may not be able to tell you exactly why your code failed a particular test case, we can often illuminate parts of your code that are incorrect/incomplete.</p></TEXT>

<p>Thank you.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Bug Clarifications</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you are asking about test cases, we are going to take all your test cases and run them with our own specially made code that each has one specific bug, then were are going to see if your test cases correct reject bad code.</p>

<p>no Joker is not going to be a possible bug. the bugs are going to be possible corner cases that are not accounted for in our special code and other stuff like that. basically just write really good test to test your own code and think of corner cases and also have some straight forward cases as well for sanity checks and you should be good</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm fairly certain even their buggy code will adhere to the Requires clause. For those kinds of situations, "it's on the user" to make sure the code is called following the function's requirements. For example, I don't think they'd try to call the shuffle() function with n = 5000 or something. </p>

<p>That being said, asserting the conditions in the Requires clause is still okay, and might be useful in testing/debugging.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't know the specifics of what we are testing you guys on but I would also assume that we are still adhering to the requires clause. So even if you assert the requirements you should still be good because that should always be true so that shouldn't be a problem</p></TEXT>

Helper Functions in Test Files</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>why do you need static helper functions in your tests?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>if you know what index you want from the deck you could just deal() from the deck that many times to access that card and you wouldn't need that helper function.</p>
<p>also I'm not really sure how you are accessing the private array without adding member functions to the class which you shouldn't do because you should not be altering the files we give you</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That's more or less what my helper function is doing: deal()ing that number of times to access the element of the array. It's true that I could do this without the helper function, but then I would be copy/pasting the same (or a very similar) loop at several points throughout the test, which would not only be hard to read but also would open up the possibility of off-by-one mistakes at every loop. </p>

<p>This helper function is how I'm "accessing" the private array (it's technically not accessing the array itself, but rather deal()s cards to give information about the array). I haven't added any member functions to the class or altered any of the .h files.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>oh ok yeah that sounds like you're all good then! Happy testing!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>(Since this question is marked Instructor-Only, I assume that it is okay to discuss implementation details here.)</p>

<p>One reason that I want to use a helper function is that the Deck class has no get() function for the elements in the "cards" array, but throughout my tests, I often find myself wanting to access a particular element of that (private) array. To that end, I've written a helper function that uses deal() to perform essentially the same role as a get() function: it returns the Card at a specified index in the "cards" array. I placed this helper function inside each of the tests for which I want to access a particular element.</p></TEXT>

<p>More specifically, I want to be able to deal cards from the deck (to allow the competitor to split) and ideally double the bet after it is placed (double down).

Remember that you have a factory function that returns a pointer to a specified subtype of Player depending on what's passed in as a parameter to the function.

<p>I'm a little confused as to how blackjack works.</p>

<p>In the spec, it says,</p>
<p>The first set of rules apply if the player has a "hard count" </p>
<ul><li>If the player's hand totals 11 or less, he always hits</li><li>if the player's hand totals 12, he stands if the dealer shows 4,5, or 6</li><li>If the player's hand totals between 13 and 16, he stands if the dealer shows a 2 through 6</li></ul>

<p>I don't understand why the player would ever stand if his total is less than 17. Doesn't the dealer hit until the dealer's total is at least 17? So wouldn't the player automatically lose if his total was less than 17?</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Understanding how blackjack works</TEXT>

<p>I made the changes and now it prints out 0 of 0 instead of Two of Spades. I think this might be something to do with my get_rank() function since all I have in it is "return rank;". Will this cause the function to return the numerical value of the TWO rank from the enum which is a 0?</p></TEXT>

<p>Anyone have suggestions on how to go about implementing this? I understand how to pick the rank/suit to assign to each index of cards, but I'm not sure how to go about initializing each one when I can't access private member variables. Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Deck constructor?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Since you can't directly access private member variables, consider assigning each index of the Deck's cards array to a Card object. For example, if I want cards[0] to be Two of Spades, I can make a Card object of rank TWO and suit SPADES, then assign the first element of the cards array the object. That way, I'm not trying to modify/access anything illegal like cards[0].rank.</p>

<p>So I understand the concept of creating the different cards, but then I am having trouble assigning them to the elements in the array.  Can we simply use the = operator to set classes equal to each other or is there another way to do it?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I've read the posts on being able to access the various Ranks and Suits by using an integer. However, I don't know how the syntax for this actually works. For example, I have in my code two loops with int i = 0 and int j = 0. Referencing the Rank and Suit enums, this should give me a TWO of SPADES. When I do temp(Card::i, Card::j) (temp being my card in this case), it throws an error.</p>

<p>Because each of our Player_testNN.cpp unit tests only include Player.h, they can only "see" the Player type, and not each of the Simple, Counting, and Competitor types (which are in the Player.cpp file). Considering that what is returned from the player_factory() function in any given unit test cpp file will be of type Player*, is there any way to test whether what is returned from the factory function is of the correct subtype of Player (i.e. Simple, Counting, Competitor)? How would we write a unit test to test literally the only thing that player_factory() does?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Testing player_factory()</TEXT>

<p>Normally, you should be able to use something like:</p>

<pre>Player* plyr = player_factory("simple");
if (dynamic_cast&lt;Simple*&gt;(plyr) == NULL) {
	return -1;
}</pre>
<p>...But, this would require that the test case has access to the <tt>Simple</tt> definition in "Player.cpp". Otherwise, the compiler is going to complain that <tt>Simple</tt> is undefined.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if we can <tt>#include "Player.cpp"</tt> in our test cases and still get through the autograder. If an instructor can enlighten us I'd appreciate it. Of course, we can always "try and see."</p>

<p>EDIT: FYI, under normal circumstances, attempting to derive the dynamic type of a polymorphic object is a pretty good indicator that you need to rethink your implementation strategy (e.g. if you're trying to access members of <tt>Simple</tt> that are not inherited from <tt>Player</tt>). But IMHO this is one of the rare situations where it may be appropriate, given that this is strictly a unit test. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ideally, you'd want your unit tests to be simpler than that. An error in your betting function shouldn't affect the performance of your player_factory() unit tests, so is there a way to determine just the type of Player without resorting to their individual strategic behaviors?</p></TEXT>

<p>For some reason, when I run it step-by-step through the debugger, v.at(3) is getting called before v.at(0), and my solution prints as "Your code: v.at(0) = -1 and v.at(3) = 1".

<p>In Player.cpp, make three static global instances of the Player subtypes - one for Simple, one for Counting, and for Competitor. Depending on the string passed in parameter to the factory function, return the address of the appropriate global variable.

<p>Thanks!</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>You seem to have the general idea down. For that setup, you would override the abstract base class "Player" functions in each of your 3 subtypes. And you are allowed to create new member variables in the derived classes. And it might be helpful for testing purposes if you created setter and getter functions, but you could probably get around without them if you tried. Could you be more specific with your question about static?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks for the reply. About static, I meant that if we declare getters and setters and other non-required functions inside of the player sub-classes do we need to declare them public? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Keep in mind that any public functions you define in your player derived classes won't be visible outside of Player.cpp, so they won't be very useful for testing.</p>
<p>Static inside a class is different from the other uses of static. In this context, it doesn't mean private. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If we have a hand inside of a player class, can it be public? or does it have to be private?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Players hand: Public or private?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If it is a member variable, then it should be private.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's not necessarily redundant (there are cases in real life where you do things like that), but it is definitely illegal for this project (thus decrees the compiler).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
So you're saying that we should make it private?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For the example you brought up, all you would have to do is create a getter for the hand and then you would be able to access all of the elements of the hand through that. And if you are going to make a member variable, like this hand, then it should be private.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But if we declare that hand as private you'd have to create duplicate code that would basically mimic the member functions of hand.cpp... For exmaple, you'd need to create a function called add_card_to_player inside of the player just to add a card. Isn't that redundant? </p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Confusion about global static const variables and file inter-dependency?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You'll refer to it by pointers, which may be passed between files and refer to the same object.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You should still have const, because it's better style. </p>

<p>So when you create a variable outside the scope of any function/class, eg.</p>

<pre>static const int i = 0;<br /><br />int main(){<br />	/*Do Something..*/<br />}</pre>
<p>you can pass it to another file via a pointer to the function, which is how you may have an inter-file constant global variable.</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<pre>//Main.cpp-----------------------<br />static const int i = 0;<br />int main(){<br />	fn(&amp;i);//Pass by address<br />}<br /><br />//Functions.cpp------------------<br />void fn(int *num){<br />	//You could do whatever you wanted to with it<br />	cout &lt;&lt; (*i + 2) &lt;&lt; endl;<br />	//but for example, lets print a number 2 greater<br />}<br /><br /></pre>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Fun fact: If you declare a const global variable in a .cpp file, the compiler (in c++, not in c) will automatically make it static.</p>

<p>This is perfectly fine:</p>
<pre>const int spam = 42;<br />int main()<br />{}</pre>
<p> If, however, the variable is non-const, you need to make it static, as is the case with the player variables you'll be declaring in Player.cpp</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm not sure what you're asking. It looks like something causes Deck_test00 to segfault right away. It could be that something in your Deck constructor goes off the end of the cards array.</p>

<p>I wrote my test cases first, as described. For one of my test cases, it hits the end and returns 0 from main. However, when i run the exe for this test, either alone or with the python script, it segfaults after it returns zero??</p>

<p>this is the end of the code for my test case.</p>

<pre>    cout &lt;&lt; "PASS 02" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
    cout &lt;&lt; "still here" &lt;&lt; endl;
} //end main</pre>
<p>I added the "still here" to see if maybe it was still running after the return 0, but the terminal output is just</p>
<pre>PASS 02<br />Segmentation Fault</pre>

Deck_test02_exe segfaulting after return 0;?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Did you write destructors for any of your classes? You don't need to, but if you did, they would get run for any local variables at the very end of main and could explain the segfault. That's a long shot, though. It's more likely your code accesses/modifies memory outside the range of an array that happens to mess up something with the destruction process.</p>

<p>Put your code through valgrind and see what you can find. When you recompile your code with -g to go through valgrind, it might make the segfault disappear, but the valgrind errors should still give you some kind of hint as to what's causing the problem.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm having a hard time avoiding magic numbers in this project. It seems like we have so many numbers we have to use according to the spec that it would almost be superfluous to create a ton of extra variables. Any tips?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
magic numbers</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's never a bad idea to declare a number as a const variable, especially if you'll be using it more than once. If you type your variable wrong, the compiler will catch it. The compiler will not flag a magic number, which can lead to bugs if you accidentaly type the wrong number. The more you utilize this number, the more opportunities you have to type it incorrectly and generate bugs.</p>

<p>TL;DR We're not concerned with memory usage, why not be safe and store it in a variable?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Generally, I agree with Jack. On the other hand, here is something to think about to help you identify cases where just using the number is ok:
If the number itself has a specific meaning and logically can't change, it doesn't need to be a variable.
For example, if you're doing calculations with degrees of a circle, you don't necessarily have to declare a variable "NUM_DEGREES_IN_CIRCLE" because it is clear that there are 360 degrees in a circle, and that value will never change.</TEXT>

<p>The Hand.h file doesn't contain any overloaded constructors for the Hand class, so no you can't. Even if you wrote another constructor, it wouldn't compile unless you modified the .h file to include a declaration of the overloaded constructor, which isn't allowed for this project.</p></TEXT>

<p>Have you provided implementation in Simple for all pure virtual functions provided in the Player.h file? Any function that is declared pure virtual in Player.h will require an implementation in any class derived from Player (Simple, Counting, Competitor), else the dervided class will be abstract.</p>

 <TEXT>
ISO C++ forbids variable length array</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I got this error yesterday. I believe the problem is that you are using a variable for your array size so at run-time the array could have variable length which is a problem to be dealt with using dynamic memory. Instead of that you can just made both your left and right arrays the size of the deck using a constant. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Right, since it isn't using dynamic memory (which you shouldn't do for this project), it is giving you an error because when it wants to allocate space for these arrays, it doesn't know how long they will be at compile time (likely because you're basing this on the parameter n, which it doesn't get until run time). To avoid this, you can make these arrays a fixed size that will surely be big enough, like the whole deck size. This allocates more memory than you need, but at this scale that isn't a problem.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I did it by making a copy of the deck as an array and then using pointers for left and right. Sometimes the problem with using arrays is not knowing the size for right and left.</p></TEXT>

problem about factory function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm a little confused about what you are trying to ask. We have already declared the function in the Player.h file you just need to implement the function (fill in code to make it work) in Player.cpp</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think a factory function just allows you that "dirty trick" that DeOrio calls it. You "know" what the user is going to ask for, so make global instances of the players so you can return a pointer to a player as such and use it. I looked at the triangle factory function in the lecture slides as a model.</p>

<p>(To avoid this, we'd have to use dynamic memory to be prepared to supply all players that the user could ever want, but we aren't doing this for this project. Polymorphism is enough for now! :D)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yep you should follow the example of the triangle classes in lecture in your Player.cpp</p>

<p>the static keyword doesn't make things global it just restricts their scope to the file they are declared in. The fact that the variables are declared outside of all functions is what makes them global.</p>

<p>like the student said above this is just a little hack we are making you do for the project so you don't use dynamic memory.</p>
</TEXT>

<p>to make global instances of the player do we just write static outside the class? I'm confused...bc in the lectures slides DeOrio did:</p>

<p>static Triangle g_triangle(3,4,5);<br /><br />static Isosceles g_isosceles(1,12);<br /><br />static Equilateral g_equilateral(5);</p>


<p>....Shouldn't I instead do something like class static Player .....etc?</p></TEXT>

<p>My inclination is that it's just how people designed c++ to be and that it's “cheaper," memory-wise.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
why can dynamic memory only be accessed by pointer?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think the main reason is the fact that dynamic variables can change size and having a set address for the dynamic variable, hence creating an instance of that, would be implying that it would stay at that address and continue being that size for the entirety of its lifespan, which is the opposite of what we want to do with dynamic variables.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
This may actually make more sense after today's lecture, where we'll be talking about the assignment operator. new always returns a pointer to the heap memory it allocated. If you dereference that pointer and assign the value to a variable, that variable will live in the current stack frame and C++ will (by default) do a shallow copy to move the values. This means that there's no way to get at heap memory, except with a pointer, even if you wanted to.
As to why it was designed that way, the suggested hypotheses seem plausible.</TEXT>

So for test case behaviors, would an example be:
Deck_test00.cpp: simple cases for each member function
Deck_test01.cpp: boundary cases for each member 
Deck_test02.cpp: stress cases for each member function
Deck_test03.cpp: nonsensical cases for each member function
Would this be a good way to organize test case behaviors for both Deck and player?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Test case file behaviors</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>that sounds like a good way to organize stuff, just remember that if one of your test cases incorrectly says that a correct implementation is incorrect we throw out the entire file so I would be on the safe side and split up things into even more files. We gave you the python script so it wouldn't be a pain to run a bunch of tests. also if you use to Makefile to generate the tar ball to submit then you don't even need to type all those files names out so there is only an upside to splitting up test cases into more files</p></TEXT>

<p>so here's a hint you really don't need to store the actual card values in a hand object the only thing that matters is what the value of all the cards in the hand is and whether or not the hand is hard or soft. This is why in the class declaration there is no array member variable</p>

<p>If you are still confused about this go play a few games of black jack in person and don't keep an actual hand just keep track of your hand's total value and see if you can still play the game.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hey class, </p>

<p>I'm having some trouble with accessing my classes in my test files.</p>
<p>On the test file, i have included:</p>

#include "Card.h"
#include "Hand.h"
#include "Player.h"
#include &lt;cassert&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;</pre>
<p>on my Player.cpp, I have included </p>
<pre>#include "Player.h"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cassert&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;</pre>

<p>and I have coded for class Simpleplayer in my Player.cpp file as a derived class. However, when i try to initialize a Simpleplayer in my testing file, as such:</p>

<pre>Simpleplayer bob;</pre>
<p>I get an error saying that "unknown type name 'Simpleplayer'". I don't think I'm misspelling anything, though I am confused about how to approach this error. any help would be appreciated. </p></TEXT>

<p>so in your test cases you should NOT be #include "Player.cpp" which means that your test case files shouldn't know what a simple player is.

 <TEXT>
static and dynamic</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Static is a horribly overused word in C++, so don't assume that two things are similar just because they're both prefaced with static. As you learned in lecture, variables can be stored in static or dynamic memory, and that's one use of the term static. The static helper functions you used in project two are a totally different meaning of static; in that case, "static" meant "Don't make this function visible outside of this .cpp file." Another form of static function can be used with classes. A class may contain something called static class members, which are described in section 12.6 of your textbook; you can use static member functions of the class to interact with those static class members.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of anything called a dynamic function in the world of C++.</p></TEXT>

Compiling Issues in Visual Studio</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>visual studio is actually bad for eecs280 project. I used last semester right now i have changed.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>The "correct" way to handle unit testing in MSVS is incompatible with the project file structure in 280, where unit tests are split between files and each has its own <tt>main</tt> function. But, there's a simple workaround that I use for 280 projects:</p>

<ul><li>When you want to make a new unit test, first create the .cpp file that will contain the <tt>main</tt> function</li><li>Right-click that file in "Solution Explorer" and choose "Properties"</li><li>In the "Property Pages" window that comes up, select "Configuration Manager" in the upper-right corner</li><li>Choose the drop-down menu in the "Configuration" column for your project and select "&lt;New...&gt;"
<ul><li>Give the configuration a name, e.g. Player_test00</li><li>Under "Copy settings from", choose "Debug"</li><li>Check the box that says "Create new solution configurations"</li></ul>
</li><li>Back in the "Property Pages" window, select "All configurations" in the "Configuration" drop-down menu at the top-left corner</li><li>Under "Configuration Properties -&gt; General" in the left-hand pane, choose "Yes" for "Excluded From Build" in the right-hand pane</li><li>Hit "Apply"</li><li>Go back to the "Configuration" drop-down menu and select the new configuration that you made before</li><li>Go back to "Excluded From Build" and select "No"</li><li>Hit "OK"</li></ul>

<p>After doing this for all your unit tests (it really doesn't take long), you'll have a menu item for each test in the "Configuration" drop-down menu on the main toolbar in your MSVS solution. You can run any of your unit tests by selecting the appropriate menu item, and compile your main program by selecting "Debug" or "Release".</p>

<p>Note that this is a "hackish" way of handling unit tests in MSVS for 280, and not the way that it's supposed to be done (don't get used to it!). The "Visual Studio way" of handling unit tests is quite graceful in my opinion. You create a "Test Project" within your solution which can link with any of your other projects. This project contains no <tt>main</tt> function--instead, it has a series of test functions and test classes (any number you want). When you compile your Test Project, each test function is treated as a main function and executed individually. In the "Test Explorer" panel, you can then see which of these tests passed/failed (based on zero/nonzero return value), how long they took to execute, how much memory they used, etc. You can also incorporate scripts that will do things like the <tt>diff</tt> comparison with a known output set, etc.</p></TEXT>

static when it's attached to a function or global variable means that only the file it's declared in can see it, pretty much its only global for that file. if you were to #include that file in another file and try to use that variable or function you would get a compiler error.
Static member variables inside a class are totally different. normally when you declare an instance of a class that object gets a copy of all the member variables, but if there is a static member variable that means there is only one copy of that variable and all instances of that class just share that one variable, so they all have the same value always.
PS a quick google search of the words static variable c++ got me plenty of sites with all this information and examples</TEXT>

<p>I would use a <tt>switch</tt> statement in a function dedicated to converting a <tt>Card::Rank</tt> into an <tt>int</tt>. IMHO, relying on the integer values of an enum is dangerous, as those values can change (e.g. by altering the order of the enumerator list, explicitly initializing one or more values in the list, or adding/removing items in the list). Such changes will break any code that relies on the integer values of the enum <em>without</em> any warnings or error messages, while changes to the enum that would break a <tt>switch</tt> statement will be flagged by the compiler.</p></TEXT>

<p>This is a silly question but I don't really understand the expose() function at all!</p>

<p>Also for the simple player it says to do nothing for shuffle and expose events…does that mean for these two functions we just have an empty function body?</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Expose and Shuffle Question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes. The expose function only becomes important for the counting player, because for him, his actions depend on the count he has which depends on the cards he has seen. So for the counting player you should have implementations for shuffled() and expose() that have to do with the count, but for the simple player, he really doesn't care. So you should have an implementation there, because without one you would get an compiler error, but the implementation is just do nothing. The compiler error arises from the fact that someone could potentially call those functions on a simple player, but since it is derived from an abstract base class, Player, with shuffled() and expose() as pure virtual functions, there would be no implementation for those functions and bad stuff would happen.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From the RME of shuffled in  Player.cppp, it says</p>

<p>Your driving program should call the player's shuffled() method immediately when it shuffles the deck.

The linked answer tells the effect that the shuffled function will have on the player's count (if he has one).</p></TEXT>

<p>1. When testing my Card constructor with the rank and suit inputs, i am trying to make a card jake, but when i initialize the card it only seems to work if i write: Card jake = Card(Card::Rank::TWO,Card::Suit::SPADES); so i was wondering why i need all of those :: rather than just having the inputs be "TWO" and "SPADES"</p>

<p>2. Ive implemented get_rank and get_suit yet when i print jake.get_rank or jake.get_suit to the output i am getting 0 for both. any reasons why this could be happening?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Two Card.cpp questions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>1. Because the ranks and suits are enums where you need to access the Card class to get.</p>

<p>2. Enums are like ints. You wanna static cast.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well if you are doing this to overload the &lt;&lt; operator, I would just copy and paste the arrays of cstrings from p3 and then compare the ints to decide what to output</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>didn't we just use the stringtoenum function in project 3?</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm not sure what part of the project you are working on though, so if you could maybe elaborate a little on that?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry about that. I'm in Card.cpp and I'm making my get rank and get suit functions. I've had their definitions just be "return suit" or "return static_cast&lt;Suit&gt;(suit), but when I print them to the standard output I am getting "0 of 0" rather than like "two of diamonds"</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So, an enum is an int, and so when you print it, it will print the integer representation of the enum. This is why we have you overload operator&lt;&lt;. In that function, you either have to use a for loop and some arrays like project 3 to get to the right string representation, or you have to have two switch statements.</p></TEXT>

<p>I totally get the answer to number 1, thanks! </p>

<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>Just finishing hand, had a small question.</p>

<p>I get that Ace can be counted as 11 or 1. If the Ace is going to make you bust, you should make it count for 1, otherwise count for 11. That was my logic for hand but I'm assuming that's not 100% correct. </p>

<p>An ace can CHANGE value after another card has been played, correct? </p>

<p>So if you were dealt a 3 then an Ace, total would be 14.</p>
<p>If you are then dealt a queen, total would still be 14. Correct?</p>

<p>Are we accounting for this change from soft-&gt;hard in Hand.cpp or do we do it later? (Just curious, because I haven't got to the player functions yet)</p>

<p>I know in hand.cpp you don't have access to the cards in the players hand, so I am assuming you account for this change of what the Ace counts as later.</p>

<p>Can anyone confirm? Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
ace hard/soft question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, you are correct. The idea is to get the hand value as high as possible without busting. So if I have an Ace and a three, it's to my advantage to have a soft hand where Ace = 11, so the total value would be 11 + 3 = 14. But once I'm dealt a Queen, then it's no longer to my advantage to have a soft hand because 14 + 10 = bust. Then I would switch my Ace to be 1 such that my hand value is now 1 + 3 + 10 = 14 - and now my hand is no longer soft. You should account for this change in Hand.cpp, yes.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>thanks for the quick response. I think I get it. </p>

<p>#taraforta</p></TEXT>

<p>yes, count it as 11 and if you go over you change it.</p>

<p>I was OP and this seemed to work for me. Try playing an online game of blackjack and you'll see an initially dealt ace will count as 11</p></TEXT>

And so it appears you cannot initialize a member variable inside a class unless you are using C++ 11.<br /><br />Note that you don't need to initialize the member variable inside the class because you can use one of the other functions included in the Player interface to do what you are trying to accomplish.</p></TEXT>

IF two aces in hand, can one be '1', and other be 11?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't think so, at least for the purposes of this project. Hard means all aces count as 1 and soft means all aces count as 11.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>I am sorry, but I have to disagree! In the spec, it says, "If the total includes an ace counted as 11, the total is</p>
<p>called "soft", otherwise it is called "hard"."</p>
<p>So it's possible for a hand with more than one ace to be counted soft, since only one ace needs to be counted as 11. All other aces would be counted as 1.</p>
<p><span style="font-family:"Calibri";font-size:medium"><span style="font-family:"Calibri";font-size:medium"></span></span></p>

 <TEXT>
<p>I don't think so, at least for the purposes of this project. Hard means all aces count as 1 and soft means all aces count as 11.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The above student answer is incorrect. If you have two aces, with one counting as 1 point and one counting as 11 points, the hand is still soft. A hand is soft if you have any ace counting as 11 points. You will never have TWO aces counting as 11 points because that would go over 21.</p>

<p>I should clarify: I was disagreeing with the statement that "soft means all aces count as 11." Hard indeed means that all aces count as 1, but soft means that at least one counts as 11. If you have three aces, two of which are counted as 1 and one of which is counted as 11, your hand is soft. I was also pointing out that there will never be a scenario where you have two aces counting as 11 points because you would bust. I apologize if my answer caused any confusion.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>If you have a soft hand (a hand with an '11' Ace) and the value of your hand eventually exceeds 21, that '11' Ace will then be counted as a '1' to avoid busting. </p>

<p>In other words, if you have a soft hand, it will become hard again if need be.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you have an ace that is being counted as 11 points, then your hand is soft, even if you have other aces that are only counting as 1 point each. If at any point, you have a soft hand and you are dealt a card that would cause you to bust, then you change the ace from counting as 11 points to counting as 1 point, and change the hand to hard. At any point, if you have a soft hand, and you get a card that will make your hand bust, you change the hand from soft from hard. </p></TEXT>

<p>I guess somebody told me incorrectly in office hours then...so then can we assume that once a hand is soft that it never goes back to hard again?</p></TEXT>

<p>Do we need to write constructors in our derived classes of players?</p></TEXT>

Player Constructors?</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>This is only necessary if there are things that need to be initialized for a class.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Err, kind of a dumb question but is it bad if we put a constructor as static? Should *all* of our "extra" functions / private member variables etc. be static?<br /><br />Right now I have an un-static extra private member variable for Counting player, and a static constructor. Is that correct?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Right now I'm calling player_factory multiple times in my Player tests (each time for a different player pointer that I run different test cases for). The player declarations look like this:</p>
<p>Player *p1 = player_factory("counting");</p>
<p>The problem is, p2 starts off with p1's last value for count (a private member variable that is altered throughout the test cases. In other words, the value of count is not being reset to 0 after the second call to player_factory. I'm worried that I implemented the static global variables wrong. Before defining player_factory, I declare static global variables of the various Player types to new players by calling the constructors. Is this not right? </p></TEXT>

<p>I think every time you start a game, you have to shuffle the deck, right? By doing so, tell the player that the deck has been shuffled and then the count resets to zero.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The above student's answer wouldn't solve the underlying problem, just mask it. Are the static variables you are referring to inside the class definition, or outside of it? Is count declared static?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So then the static global variables are players? Or player pointers? and you're calling the constructor on the same static players multiple times?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>the static variables are defined outside of the class, and count is not declared as static. When I declare the static global variables, I assign them to a new player variable by calling the Simple or Counting constructors. is it wrong to create new players by calling the constructors in this way?</p></TEXT>

<p>Our shuffle function seems to work fine when only shuffling the deck of cards once. However, when we try to simply put the body of the function within a for loop, the assert(before.get_rank() == after.get_rank()) evaluates to false. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Shuffle</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This seems like it could be a question better suited for office hours, but it is possible that you aren't resetting all the variables within your loop. For example, if you set the <em>before</em> card prior to the loop call and never change it, it will be the same as <em>after </em>after a single shuffle, but may not (and likely won't be) after further shuffles. Make sure you are understanding how the shuffle function works completely.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
deck test</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>After calling shuffle, the "before" card shouldn't change, it is set in stone prior to shuffle being called, so calling shuffle shouldn't change it. I'm not for sure, but it sounds like there could be a bug in your shuffle function. This may be a better question for Office Hours.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can use GDB to track when before changes. It's called a watchpoint, you set it like this:</p>
<pre>(gdb) watch before</pre>
<p>Keep in mind that before must be in the scope that gdb can see, just like when you access any other variable from gdb (i.e. you have to be in the function that has before defined. You could set a breakpoint to right after before is declared and then set a watchpoint).</p>

<p>another 5 opens up .. 9+1+1+5+5 = 21<br /><br />so for the hand.cpp the handissoft and handaddcard functions can either keep it simple to one ace can be 11 and another ace will be 1 under this situation?<br />or should we code for scenerio with two aces with possibilities of 1 and 11, 1 and 1, 11 and 1?<br /><br /></p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
two Aces, one 11 and one 1, or two aces can be '1', and '1'</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can have multiple aces in a hand. However, you can never have more than one ace counting as 11 (because that would always bust). If you have at least one ace that is counting as 11 points, then your hand is soft, even if you have three other aces that are only counting as 1 point each. I hope that answers your question.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm having trouble working out the implementation for hand_is_soft; obviously if adding 11 to the hand would make it over 21 we would opt for a hard ace. But how are we supposed to know for an ace already in the hand that it can change from 11 to 1 or vice versa if all we have to keep track of the hand is the total value? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
hand_is_soft trouble</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
You also keep track of a boolean value that tells you whether the hand is hard or soft. If its soft, then you have an ace that is counting as 11 points. if it is hard, then either there are no aces present or ALL aces are being counted as 1 point.</TEXT>

<p>So the spec says that the test file should return anything but 0 if the functions are buggy but how do we test for Deck() in this way?</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
testing constructors</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Use assert().  It always returns a non-zero number.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You need to think about what the correct behavior for Deck() is. If your test case demonstrates that Deck() is not behaving that way, return a non-zero value. For example, you can figure out what you think the first card in a newly constructed deck should be, and use deal() to see if the first card in your new deck matches that. Hint: this would be a great place for an assert. If you assert that correctFirstCard and firstCardDealt are the same, and they actually are not the same, assert will cause your program to exit and return a non-zero value.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what array you're referring to in your original post. Your test cases won't be able to access the cards array from Deck, because it's a private member of Deck.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For the number of cards remaining, if you deal two cards, then shuffle, then deal another two cards and check how many cards were remaining, it would be 48 right, because the deck was never reset or should the next pointer always be reset to the first card in the deck in the shuffle function, which would make the above answer 2?</p></TEXT>

<p>So we decided to keep count inside of the counting player class, but when I write a getter function for the private count variable the compiler tells me that it doesn't recognize it inside of the Player object. I think this is because I'm creating my counting player variable via the player factor and since up-casting is done at run-time, the compiler will only recognize that variable as the abstract "player" object which doesn't contain the getCount function. How do I get around this? </p>

<p>Player is dealt a king and a six, so his hand valueis 16. Since this is not a natural 21, he plays his hand (meaning he draws until he either stands or busts). The next card in the deck is Ten of Hearts. Since the Player's hand value is between 13 and 16, and the card to be dealt is not between 2 and 6, I thought that Player should hit.

<p>Well there are a lot of bugs that could go wrong for any of the functions we tested for. A good way to create tests would be to go through your implementation and think how each of the parts in your code is eliminating some "bug" or "source of error" that another person might not have caught. But of course you would've already written most of your tests if you have an implementation, wouldn't you? (Test-driven development ftw)</p></TEXT>

<p>Dealer is dealt Ace of Clubs, and then Three of Clubs (hole card). That means his value should be 14. After Player plays his hand and then stands, dealer plays his hand. He is first dealt Jack of Spades, which would bring his value to 24. Shouldn't the hand-playing end here since dealer busts? I don't understand why in the correct output, dealer is then dealt Eight of Diamonds after already busting.</p>
<p>This is the correct output given to us:</p>

<p>Hand 2 bankroll 95</p>
<p>Player bets 5</p>
<p>Player dealt King of Hearts</p>
<p>Dealer dealt Ace of Clubs</p>
<p>Player dealt Seven of Hearts</p>

<p>Dealer's hole card is Three of Clubs</p>

<p>Dealer busts</p></TEXT>

blackjack_test00: Hand 2</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Remember that the value of an Ace is fluid in Blackjack. When the dealer is first dealt the Ace of Clubs and Three of Clubs, his hand value is 11 + 3 = 14 because it's to his advantage to have the highest hand value possible without exceeding 21. Then when the dealer is dealt Jack of Spades, leaving his Ace as an 11 (a "soft" ace) would not be to his advantage because he would bust, since 14 (current hand value) + 10 (Jack value) = 24. This is where he's allowed to convert his ace into a 1 (a "hard" ace), so now the new value of his hand is 1 + 3 + 10 = 14. </p>

<p>Then, when he's dealt the Eight of Diamonds, his total value is 14 + 8 = 22. He has no aces in the hand to convert, so at this point he's just plain busted. Hopefully that makes sense.</p></TEXT>

<p>The dealer is still a Player, just with a very strict set of rules and a card face down. That means that certain rules of Blackjack (i.e. hard and soft hands) still apply to them.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When I say that the Ace is fluid, I mean that it can take on two different values (1 or 11) depending on the scenario, and a player is allowed to switch between values during gameplay. The best way to figure out which value it should take on is to consider what's most advantageous to the player given his/her current hand value. If you can add an 11 to the hand without busting, that's more advantageous. If you can't, then add 1. </p>

<p>And remember that you have a bool member variable to keep track of whether or not you have an 11-Ace in your hand. If it comes to the point where adding an 11-Ace to the hand would not be advantageous to the player, then consider: is there an Ace already in the hand counting for 11? If so, can I switch it to 1 so as not to bust?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>can you give a hint as to how ace is fluid? do you account for this fluidity within blackjack.cpp or within a Hand or player function?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is it correct to write test case files for every single boundary and general case scenario?  For example, in player when testing the draw function, would it make sense to test every possible scenario for hard and soft ACEs?</p>

<p>file22: Players hand total is 17 with a soft ACE and Dealer has a 10. Player should stand.</p>
<p>file23: Players hand total is 17 with a hard ACE and Dealer has a 10. Player should stand.</p></TEXT>

<p>The spec says that it's to your advantage to have more test files rather than fewer, since any incorrect test files will be thrown out. So in that respect, yes your way is better than putting every single test you can imagine into one giant file.</p>

<p>That said, I imagine that 80 files might be difficult to maintain; you might consider combining every few test files. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can test however you want to test. I feel as though the student answer is a good response.</p>

<p>It would make sense to check all possible outcomes.</p>

<p>Edit: And also to mirror what Tara said - you may be taking to "split your test cases into different files" a bit too far. Similar test cases can be combined into one file without too much worry as long as you are sure of what you're testing. I believe my final count was 4 for deck and 10 for player.</p></TEXT>

<p>Can someone explain a doubly linked list verses a singly linked list?l</p>

<p>Thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Doubly Linked List</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The reason the double list was brought up was the removeBack() function.  If the list had 2000 elements, a single link would have to go through 1999 elements before we can figure out what element to set <em>last</em> to.  Remember, we don't instantly know what node is at position 1999, we just know how to start at the first node and move forward.  However, with the double link list, we can just get the previous node from the last node instead of walking through thousands of elements.</p>

<p>A sort of analogy (although not great...) would be if you were standing in a line with other people.  A single list is a line where you can only see the person in front of you.  A double link list is a line where you can see the person in front of you and behind you.  The connection is thinking of the line as the list, and the people as the nodes.</p>

<p>Hmmm... Did you create a constructor for Simple? Are you defining all of the virtual functions in Player.h in your Simple class definition? I would check those.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>First, you shouldn't need a constructor for simple (I don't have one).  Second, make sure you have defined the functions from player.h in your simple class (and not just set the virtual functions to 0).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so even for the functions that the simple player doesnt use, I should still define them?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes. If there are any functions not defined in Simple but defined as virtual in Player, then they are virtual in Simple. If any functions are virtual in Simple, you cannot create an instance of the class.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>how do you write a constructor for simple if there are no member variables??</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>Im just a little confused with player.cpp. From what I've gathered we are declaring 3 subclasses of Player at the top, then implementing them below. Are we supposed to invent our own member functions and variables or are we just supposed to implement the ones in the player class specific to each different player?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Player.cpp</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're correct in that you need 3 function definitions before implementation in the player.cpp file.</p>

<p>You're provided an interface of a player, so in the very minimum you must implement the functions that are defined in player; however, you may create private helper functions if you so choose. Please note that you shouldn't make any public functions, because when your project gets graded the files they're tested against will not assume any functions exist outside the spec.</p></TEXT>

<p>You should shuffle the deck as if you did not deal out any cards (you can also check the provided deck_test to ensure this is how you shuffle).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes. We specify that you have to "undeal" the cards so to speak because there is a way to do it such that the cards get physically dealt. If you never move the cards, then you just shuffle and reset the next pointer, like you said.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Okay, thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But the deal card function doesn't actually remove cards from the cards[] array. So doesn't this mean I really don't have to do any more work? I just have to make sure to start the shuffle at the beginning of the cards[] array and not at the next pointer or something?</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>So, once the last card is dealt in a deck, if that happens, where should the next pointer point to? like back to the first card in the deck? or what?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Deck deal fuction</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well that should never happen, as you should reshuffle the deck whenever it gets below 20 cards, and any 20 cards will get you through a hand, meaning you will never reach the end of the deck without resetting the next pointer through the shuffle. So we probably shouldn't worry about it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Good point but we really won't need to worry about it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah thats what I thought too, but I was just worried about going off the end of an array, because in the RME it just says that the deck can't be empty, meaning that technically this could be an issue.</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So, if the last card is dealt, you can increment the next pointer. Yes, this will make it point off the end of the array, but that doesn't matter because you never dereference it. It is up to the *user* to know when they have dealt all the cards, and to call shuffle again without trying to access that invalid next pointer. In your driver function, this should never happen. When we test individually, it might. But we know how many cards have been dealt and won't try and access next (i.e. call deal()) after dealing all the cards.</p></TEXT>

<p>Sorry if that was unclear. From the spec: each time the counting player sees a 10 through Ace, he "subtracts one from the count." Each time he sees a 2 through 6, he "adds one to the count." So basically this function is useful for incrementing or decrementing the player's card count.</p></TEXT>

<p>I seem to be having a problem with the shuffle and cut portion of the driver program.  I've written a function that takes the deck and makes cuts seven times.

cut problem</TEXT>

<p>That is odd. You should just be calling get_cut() seven times, once for each cut, in order to get the random number for the shuffle function. Honestly it seems like you are skipping the 22 and jumping straight to the next cut of 33. Are you one off after the first cut? And if so check your code comprehensively going from the first cut to the second to make sure nothing is calling get_cut() again before it is used again to shuffle the deck.</p>

<p>What happens if, for example, a player is dealt a Two of Spades and a Two of Hearts, and then gets an Ace (which counts as 11 since he doesn't bust), and hits again and is dealt another Ace. Obviously you don't want this card to have the value of 11, so add_card should change soft to false right? My hand_is_soft function returns the boolean soft. But in Player.cpp hand_is_soft should still be true since there exists an ace that is counted as 11 in the hand, right? How can I fix this bug?</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
add_card/hand_is_soft/draw testing</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No. You are soft as long as you have at least one Ace that is counting as 11. So in your example, even though the next Ace will be considered as a 1, you still have the first Ace acting as an 11, so you are still soft. Meaning that your add_card() would in fact not change the member variable soft to false. It would stay true.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No. You are soft as long as you have at least one Ace that is counting as 11. So in your example, even though the next Ace will be considered as a 1, you still have the first Ace acting as an 11, so you are still soft.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>hand_is_soft() is just a glorified getter function. It will only return the member variable soft. So in your add_card()  you just need to change or not change the soft member variable according to the card added and the spec.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I edited the students' answer. I hope it helped clarify.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But if my add card function changes soft based on whether the card passed into add_card will make the player bust or not, how can I make hand_is_soft not change?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yup.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so if soft was already true, and add_card was called, but the ace added to the hand makes the player bust, the value added should be 1 rather than 11.  the boolean variable shouldn't be changed though. </p></TEXT>

<p>Hello, I'm just wondering if I have this right. When you derive a class from a parent class and initialize an instance with a pointer to the parent class, the constructor first runs in the parent class (none or virtual if an ADT) and then runs in the derived class. Then when you delete the class via pointer, the destructor first runs in the derived class and then calls the destructor of the parent class. Is this right? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Derived destructors</TEXT>

<p>I think you are correct</p></TEXT>

Testing code in parts</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From what I can tell, you have two issues.</p>

<p><strong>Issue 1</strong></p>
<p>Here's what happens when you run the command you mentioned:</p>

<ol><li>g++ looks for and finds the file <em>Card_test00.cpp</em></li><li>Your <em>Card_test00.cpp </em>probably has <em>#include "Card.h"</em> somewhere in it.  This tells the compiler to literally copy and paste <em>Card</em><i>.h</i> into your file, which is correct, so now it knows what a Card object is.</li><li>However!  Even though the compiler knows what a properly-formed Card object looks like (from the class header), it doesn't know where the functions are that actually implement Card behavior (i.e. <em>Card.cpp</em>).  This is why it's a "undefined reference" error: g++ knows that we can, for example, construct a Card (<em>Card.h</em>), but not how to <em>(Card.cpp</em>) -- it's missing a reference.  So we must also give g++ our <em>Card.cpp</em> on the command line so that it can link the two source files together.</li></ol>

<p>TLDR, try this instead:</p>
<pre>g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror -O1 Card_test00.cpp Card.cpp</pre>

<p><strong>Issue 2</strong></p>
<p>Look at your get_rank() and get_suit() functions.  They are very nearly correct, but when you return Card::rank you are specifying that we should return rank as defined in the Card class (since you used the scope resolution operator ::).  How do we access data members of an object within a class function?</p></TEXT>

<p>In our competitor class we have a private int variable called count (derived from counting player) that gets incremented by expose correctly.  However, after our bet function is called, the count is somehow reset back to zero after expose is correctly used to make the count == 3 (checked by placing cout statements in both the bet and expose functions).  I know this is probably hard to figure out without seeing the code but if anyone has any ideas, that would be greatly appreciated!</p></TEXT>

Confused as to how to use delete [] here in grow. The spec says to use delete [] to release the memory from the data array. I would think this would mean to just put<div><br /></div><div>delete [] data;</div><div><br /></div><div>But i'm not sure, and I don't really know how to use valgrind to check. Any help?</div></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Delete [] function (lab 09)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The delete [] command is used to free up all of the dynamic memory allocated for an array in the heap. This is needed because just the regular delete command will only free up the first spot of the array's memory, because the name of an array refers to the address of the first spot in an array. So, if in your case above, data points to an array of dynamically allocated memory and you wish to free up all of it, hence to leak no memory, you should indeed use delete [].</p>

<p>Valgrind is a great feature that is especially helpful in finding memory leaks. The instructions for using it is in the spec for the lab. I imagine it will become much more useful in future projects (project 5) where it would be a rather simple and devastating error to leak some small portion of memory.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
For the destructor it sounds like we use <div><br /></div><div>delete[] data;</div><div><br /></div><div>again but this results in a double deletion error described in the memory models lecture because delete[] data was already used in grow(). Any help?</div></TEXT>

<p>The spec says that you will be graded just on the number of buggy implementations that are caught by your tests, so it's not graded on having tests in separate files. However, the spec also says it's within your best interest to split it up into multiple files just because, in the event that one of your tests marks a correct implementation as buggy, the test file that did this will be disregarded for subsequent tests.

a short question about driver program</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you have deck as a member variable of the player class, of which you have a pointer named player you'd refer to the PUBLIC member variable via:</p>
<pre>player-&gt;deck.cards_remaining();//equiv: (*player).deck.cards_remaining()</pre>
<p>The -&gt; operator, de-references player, giving you a player object of which you access PUBLIC member variables through the dot operator, which will in turn give you a deck object to operate on, and not a pointer.</p>

<p>Please not that this only works for public member variables, you should use getters/setters to access and modify private member variables.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>if you player has a member variable that is of type Deck and it's not a pointer to a Deck, and you also have a pointer to a player then yes it will be </p>
<p>player-&gt;Deck.cards_remaining()</p>
<p>remember that -&gt; is only for pointers to objects that have member variables or member functions (pretty much if you have pointer to a class or struct object)</p>
<p>And the . operator is for when you have a variable of that class or struct type NOT a pointer </p>

<p>If you make the player's bankroll a Player member variable, then you will have no way to access or modify it outside of the class implementation.

<p>Nope. You want to be able to access the player's Hand from the driver program, so instead make a separate Hand object in blackjack.cpp. Since the Player header doesn't include a Hand as a member variable for the Player, even if you do include a Hand as a data member for the derived classes, you wouldn't be able to access it in the driver.</p></TEXT>

So the spec says to be careful about the integer divison of 3/2.
Are we supposed to pay the player using integer division? 
Or do we have to find a way around this to make it what the true payout should be (using casting or something)?

 <TEXT>
<p>That's a good point. I took it to mean that the 3/2 payout would be determined by how that value would be computed using integer division, since the spec uses the example of a 3/2 payout of 5 being 7, which is the value that would result using integer division. </p></TEXT>

<p>I'm currently working on the implementation of player, but when I try to create the global instance of each class (for the factory function to return a pointer to) I am met with the error:</p>

<p>True. If we remain true to the EFFECTS clause of the cards_remaining function, regardless of if it will never be called under those particular parameters, it should still return a value of 0 when called on a deck that has been all dealt out.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm a little bit confused, y'all. You're right that the deck is reshuffled <strong>in the game</strong> if it contains fewer than 20 cards; however, in testing specific to Deck, one could certainly test the cards_remaining() method for a deck containing fewer than 20 cards (or no cards at all), given that the function has no requirements.</p>

<p>And if every card from a full 52-card deck has been dealt out, then that deck has 0 cards left, no?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
It should return 0 if all cards have been dealt. Your driver should never get here, but we will test your deck class on its own.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That becomes one of those nonsense tests. Because deal REQUIRES that the deck is not empty, by dealing a 53rd card, you are testing something where anything can happen, and technically be correct.</p></TEXT>

<p>If the player isn't dealt a natural 21, the player plays until either standing or busting. At that point, announce the player's total.

<p>Player's total is 18</p>
<p>// Announce dealer's hole card, then announce each card given to dealer</p>
<p>Dealer's total is 17</p>

How can you make cards_remaining() notice the difference between no cards dealts and all 52 cards dealt?  Is it possible?

 <TEXT>
Cards_remaining()</TEXT>

<p>So cards_remaining() should return the number to cards that the deck has yet to deal out, since its last shuffle/reset. So in the case of no cards dealt, it should return 52, and in the case of all 52 cards dealt, it should return 0. So the problem is how to find out how many cards have already been dealt, and hence how many are left to be dealt. (the next pointer is key here).</p></TEXT>

The only way  I think this can be done is creating a cheesy global bool variable and changing it when next gets incremented one time.  Is this allowed?
The reason why this is complicated is because next gets incremented in deal, so *next will be the same for both cases.  Therefore, there is no way to tell the difference without doing something that is considered "bad coding".</TEXT>

<p>If next gets incremented in deal, when the last card is dealt, it should point to the memory address one *after* the end of the array. Thus, next would point to two different spots in both cases. In one, it would point to the first card, in the other, it would point to the spot after the end of the array. Use this to your advantage.</p></TEXT>

Bet for counting player not working</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Can you describe the problem more? Like is it not betting what it should bet or is it not even compiling at all?</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>Because it is a member function in player and all players derived from player, a player can use the bet function.</p>
<p>So if c is a pointer to a player, that *should* be valid syntax. My next remedy to suggest would be using a debugger and see exactly where and when you are skipping over the bet function if that is indeed what is happening. Is this in your driver program or a smaller test? If it's in the driver, I would try making a smaller unit test and seeing what you can find there. Post a followup if you have another question!</p></TEXT>

<p>So this function will use the spec to determine if this player wants to draw another card. The parameter "Card dealer" refers to the "up card" in your second question.

It means that to you, the function will never not go into one of those if statements, and thus the function will always return.

<p>The spec says that the dealer hits until either reaching 17 or busting. However, I wanted to clarify this behavior when the player has between 17 and 21. Let's say the player has 20 points, and the dealer has 14 points. The dealer then hits and gets a four card. He now has 18, which is above 17. However, he/she would still need more points to win the hand, so would they still hit in this instance, or hold just because the hand is worth at least 17?</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Oh nvm I found it</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For the dealer, you are correct the dealer has to hit until reaching at least 17. For this you can just keep dealing them cards to signify they "hit."</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Unless I'm missing something, the dealer can't use the same draw function as the player.  The dealer needs to hit until reaching at least 17.  And if the dealer has soft 18 while the player has 14, the dealer is not going to hit.</p></TEXT>

<p>How do we "fill in the remainder of the deck with the cards remaining in the other side"?</p>
<p>Say I gut at 48 so that there are 4 cards on the right and 52 on the left. So after I run out of the right side, and have used 3 cards from the left, what do I do with the remaining 45 from my left side of the deck? Does the top card of my 45 card left deck become the top card in my shuffle deck (which is the 7 card deck)? Or do I just simply place the 45 cards on top of the shuffle deck so the top card of my 45 deck is after the shuffle the first card to be dealt?</p>
<p>Hope that made sense, </p>
<p>Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
shuffle question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>After you cannot alternate between the piles anymore, you need to copy the rest of the side into the bottom of the deck. So with your example, you have filled array positions 0-6 with 7 cards by alternating. Then fill the remainder of the positions (7-51) with the rest of the 45 cards in your left pile.</p>

<p>It's as if you physically pick up the rest of the pile and shove it on the bottom of your shuffled deck.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Depending on how you're doing it, you don't need to modify the order of those last cards. Just copy them over into your shuffled deck.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So then I don't even have to touch the rest of the deck have rearranging the first (0-6) array positions since the positions (7-51) will remain unaffected right?</p></TEXT>

<p>You don't need to turn in any test cases for those programs, but it would be to your advantage to test them on your own!</p></TEXT>

<p>We are confused on how to handle the aces. All the spec says is "An ace is worth either 1 or 11--whichever is more advantageous to the player." We are struggling on determining which is more advantageous. </p>
<p>Also, can the value of the ace change once you set it. For example, if you are dealt an ace and a 6, and make the ace soft for a value of 17, then you hit to get a 5, can you change the ace to hard to prevent the value from busting.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Ace strategy</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Also, with regard to your question about which is more advantageous - remember that the goal of Blackjack is to get the highest hand value possible without exceeding 21. So it's always to my advantage to add more to my hand as long as I can stay under 21. Once it gets to the point where adding 11 would not be advantageous - let's say I have a hard hand of 19 - then adding a 1-Ace would be to my advantage, since 19 + 11 is a bust.</p></TEXT>

Doesn't it make more sense to let the player figure out how they will bet?</p></TEXT>

<p>My question is that when writing the bet function, the Simple, Counting, and Competitor players all have different methods of betting. </p>

<p>You make 3 static global players (Simple, Counting, Competitor), and the player factory function returns a pointer to one of the 3 players</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Let me break "3 static global players" down a bit.</p>
<p>You need 3 because (obviously) you have 3 different types of players.</p>
<p>They should be global such that they can be accessed anywhere within Player.cpp (as in to be returned by your player factory)</p>
<p>They should be static such that they can ONLY be accessed within Player.cpp (i.e. your main file won't be able to link to them).</p>

<p>Your factory should return a pointer to the correct pointer to be used, doing this allows your static (this-file-only) players to be used outside of Player.cpp, but in a very controlled way.</p></TEXT>

I have a couple questions, when I am testing, do it do "make Card" or "g++ -pedantic..."? 
I'm assuming the second one. But when I do "./Card_test00" it said the file is not in the directory, even though it's all in the same place. I have checked spelling many times, any ideas why this could be happening?</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>you don't actually need to hold the cards dealt, think about the hand class and what member variables it has.</p>

<p>also you are NOT allowed to change any .h files (if you do then it will likely result in a compilation error for the autograder)</p>
<p>also is vector.h one of the allowed libraries you are allowed to include for the project? answer no it's not so you couldn't even use vector if you wanted to and if you wrote one yourself the autograder wouldn't compile the extra file with the rest of your files so you would once again get a compile error</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So i have a for loop that keeps playing hands as long as the bankroll is greater than the minimum and as long as the number of hands that are supposed to be played haven't been played yet. However for some reason it only conducts the first hand of the game and doesn't go beyond that. What could be going wrong?My partner and I thinking that maybe the hand instances and the player instance need to be "reset" back to default..but even after doing this it doesn't work</p>

<p>Since counting player follows the same strategy as simple player for the draw function, is it necessary to test draw for counting player?

 <TEXT>
Testing draw for Counting Player</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Maybe an instructor can confirm, but I thought that was sort of the point. By testing the Counting player's draw function, you're in effect making sure that your Simple player works as intended too. (And I'm fairly certain that if you want to expose all bugs, you'll need to test all of the Counting player's functions, which includes draw.)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>just test it in counting sorry for the confusion since that is what you are suppose to submit tests for</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>if you are overriding the function in counting then yes you should test it, if you are not and you're just inheriting the function then no you shouldn't need to test it because it's the same function</p></TEXT>

<p>Wait, in that case I'm a little confused. Since the Counting player is supposed to follow the Simple player's draw strategy, we don't need to test it?</p>

 <TEXT>
Straight from the spec: "a wager of 5 would pay 7 if a natural 21 is dealt: (3 * 5) / 2 is 7 in integer arithmetic."
The spec just indicates how the integer arithmetic is done.  It makes no indication of what should be done to be honest.</TEXT>

<p>Straight from the spec: "a wager of 5 would pay 7 if a natural 21 is dealt: (3 * 5) / 2 is 7 in integer arithmetic."</p></TEXT>

<p>It should be 7. The note in the spec is to make it clear the order in which the math is done so that it's the correct amount. If you just did the natural looking 3/2 * wager, it'd go to 1 * wager = wager. By doing (3 * wager) / 2 you get a correctly changed value.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>The dealer also shouldn't be betting or making/losing money. I think it should also be impossible for the dealer to get what would be a natural 21 for the player, since he has to hit until he shows at least 17, so he won't stand on his two cards.</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>Oh I forgot he gets to look at that right away before he plays. My bad. So yeah, if he gets an ace and a face card he would get a natural 21, and stand there. This wouldn't have any special effect though, except that the dealer's probably going to win. (Unless the player gets 21 too.)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Followup question for Jon's answer:</p>

<p>What if the dealer is dealt a 10 and has an 8 as his/her hole card? From my understanding, the dealer would stand in this case because he/she would have a hand value of 18, which is greater than 17.</p>

<p>Provided my logic isn't flawed (which it very well may be), couldn't this also be extended to the dealer having a 10 and an Ace to begin with, giving him/her a "natural 21?"</p>

<p>In the 26 case, the two halves are even and you just alternate. I would guess that if it only works then, you could have a problem with determining that one half has run out and getting all of the remaining cards from the other half, since this happens in every other case.</p></TEXT>

<p>23, because you are already counting the ace as 1 in this case.</p></TEXT>

<p>Right, once you've subtracted the ten once, you're back to a hard hand and the value can't be changed again in this way (unless you get another ace).</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>So, just checking, if a player is dealt a 4 and a 7, then hits, and receives a 10, this is not a natural 21.<br />With this unnatural 21, I still need to check the dealer's hand in case the dealer also gets a 21, for in that case it's a push, right?</p></TEXT>

Non-natural 21</TEXT>

<p>Pretty sure that if you get a 21 and its not a natural 21 then the round should just end there and you should win.</p>

It depends on how you implemented deal(). There's a way to do it so that cards don't actually get removed from the array, and there's a way to do it so that they are. if you did the first way, then the cards are there, just next has moved. if you did the second way, you have to put the cards back before shuffling.</TEXT>

<p>Our count private variables are defined in Counting and Competitor players. For testing, we are trying to implement a getter function that returns the count. When we do implement a getter function within the derived classes, it is giving us this error:</p>

<p>Are we also supposed include the getter function in Simple player? It gives us the same error. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Getter function for obtain count</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Because of the abstraction separation of the documentation of the class declarations in the .h file and the implementations in the .cpp files, we necessitated a player_factory function. The problem here is that, while the compiler will allow you to get around not "seeing" the derived classes by returning a pointer to a player that happens to also be a counting player and overriding the functions as desired, it only has so much faith in our abilities. So when you try to call get_count(), for example, on a player, the compiler doesn't know that this player has this member function because it can only see the abstract base class player prior to runtime. Therefore with this setup, we cannot actually implement member functions in our derived classes that weren't declared in the abstract base class.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think you might have to just test your count based on the results of your bet function.</p></TEXT>

Declaring an instance of a derived class</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well your error depends on where you are creating an instance of this SinglePlayer. If you are trying to create it in Player.cpp, like a static global for your player_factory function, then I don't have a clue. But if you are trying to create it elsewhere, the issue is that the class SinglePlayer and its implementations are in player.cpp and you shouldn't be including that. Therefore you should do like I suggested above and implement the player_factory function and use its output to create a pointer to an instance of this SinglePlayer.</p></TEXT>

<p>It means that you will likely increment the hand number in a way that will make it so that after you quit playing hands, due to either of the conditions that would end the blackjack game, you will need to decrement it in order to give out the true number of hands that were played before ending.

 <TEXT>
Making test cases simpler by directly changing value, soft</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well even if there was, you wouldn't want to really do that would you? Because by doing that, I assume, you could make a hand that was deemed soft even though it really wasn't, creating a test you are garunteed not to have to deal with in any run through of the program, and maybe even eliminating some correct implementations of the autograder's that do not take this into effect, and shouldn't need to.</p></TEXT>

<p>How many deck test cases should we have? I know there isn't really a concrete answer to this. However, there are only four member functions in the Deck class and isn't much variety to with what you can test unlike the player test cases with the three derived classes. I am finding these quite repetitive and tedious as I have written seven so far and I'm running out of ideas with what to test. Should each test case be a unique scenario? How many test cases can one write with only four member functions to work with?</p>

<p>Yep, pretty much, unless of course exposed cards are relevant to your Competitor as well. The point of the expose() function is for the Counting player to take note of the "exposed" face-up card in order to count it properly, and the Simple player does nothing for exposed cards. So yes you're right!</p></TEXT>

Can subclasses inherit private member vaiable and private member functions?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Nope. But if you change the private to protected then they do. But don't do that...</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No, but subclasses can inherit protected member variables and protected member functions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It has no member variable because it keep track of its variables through the private member variables of the triangle class. This is through a complex set of setter and getter functions that this project does not allow us.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>but subclasses cannot inherit private</p>
<p>member variables?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Subclasses can inherit protected member variables. Therein lies the one difference between private and protected. Private member variables are accessible to no one but member functions of that class. Protected allows for access of these variables by derived/subclasses as well.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>my question is subclasses cannot inherit private member variables. Then how it can keep track of its variables?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So subclasses cannot inherit private member variables of the classes they are derived from without some help from some getter and setter functions. Subclasses are however allowed access to protected member variables from the classes they are derived from. Private and protected are two different things.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>it sounds like subclasses can inherit these private member variables but cannot access directly without get or set function like other classes. In  the instance of the derived class still has these private member variables.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Subclasses do "inherit" the private member variables in that they're still there in memory, but they don't "inherit" them from a visibility standpoint.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This thread is confusing me a lot about something I'm sure I understood properly prior to reading it. From my understanding, subclasses always inherit private member variables in that when an instance of the subclass is created, it comes with that variable initialized to however the constructor for the variable initializes it. To make these member variables accessible to the subclasses, you can make it protected such that the data can be accessed by all the derived classes or you can just implement a public getter function in the parent class that can be called in any derived class to call the data.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>There is also a difference between "accessing" variables in a derived class and "inheriting" variables which seem to be used interchangeably in this thread. And the student response suggests that the project would not allow implementing separate getter/setter functions in a derived class, but I disagree because you can always add member functions in a derived class and any classes that are derived from this derived class will also inherit these public member functions. This would not require modifying the implementation of the abstract base class that is done in Players.h. If someone could clarify my understanding, that would be much appreciated!!!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok you are correct in that "inherit" and "accessing" are two different things. So, contrary to what I said above, subclasses do indeed "inherit" private member variables from the classes they are derived from, meaning that upon creation, those member variables are created and stored within the instance of the subclass. The problem arises when the subclass attempts to change those private member variables, because it is unable to "access" them without the help of getter and setter functions. If the member variables were instead protected, then the derived/sub classes would be "inherit" <strong>and </strong>also be able to "access" them.     </p>

<p>With reference to this project, we can indeed create public functions in, for instance, the Simple player, and any derived classes of that Simple player would indeed be granted "access" to those functions. We cannot however use these functions for a separate reason entirely. Because of the separation of these ADT's, all files that require players will only #include Player.h, and not Player.cpp. Because of this, and the fact that we are not to change the .h files, any file that requires a Player of some sort can only see the member functions and member variables allocated to a Player in the abstract base class. Because of this, the compiler will not allow the calling of any functions defined and created in the subclasses of Player, and not in Player, because it does not know of their existence.</p>

<p>Another problem that arises from this same setup is the question of how we would be able to ever create an instance of these subclasses if the compiler doesn't even know they exist. This is circumvented by the use of the player_factory function, that will allow us to create a pointer to <strong>just a player </strong>the type of player is decided at runtime. Now, if any of the member functions of a player are called on this new player we have a pointer to, the compiler can look at the implementations of this function in both Player and subclass of this new player in specific and, due to polymorphism (virtual functions), choose the correct implementation of the function we wish to call. <strong>But </strong>this can only be done on functions that the compiler can see prior to runtime, hence the functions that were defined in the .h file for just a Player.</p>

<p>I hope this helped. Please tell me if you found any of the above particularly confusing.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Agreed on everything. I only meant that creating getter or setter functions in the derived classes would be within the scope of the project in that they could be used for the implementation of the subsequent classes that are derived.</p></TEXT>

<p>I seem to find discrepancies about if we should implement getters/setters in this project.</p>

<p>My competitor inherits from counting, but since count is a private member variable I found myself duplicating code to instantiate it, declaring it private again and setting it to 0 in the constructor. Is this alright, or should I be writing a getter/setter function to access this? Either way, it seems like I need to have some extra code to set it equal to 0 at the construction of my competitor player...</p>

<p>Thanks.</p></TEXT>

<p>Valgrind is mostly used to find memory leaks. If you're accessing memory outside of the array, I would use gdb to debug your issue. Gdb can print the value of the variable you are using to index through the array, and you can see if that value is greater than the size of your array.</p></TEXT>

<p>Say you have an ace counted as an 11. Can it change to be counted as a 1 as you add more cards to the hand? Or once you count it as 11 it is indefinitely counted as 11?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
hard/soft question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can (and should) change it to 1 if necessary. For example, if you have an 11-Ace in your hand, and the next card added to your hand would make your total hand value exceed 21, then you can switch your 11-Ace to a 1-Ace, in effect reducing your hand value by 10 and changing from a "soft" to "hard" hand. But do note that, until that point where you're about to exceed 21. it's in your best interest to keep the Ace valued at an 11, since you're trying to make the highest hand value possible (not over 21).</p></TEXT>

<p>So just to be sure, we should only print the player/dealer hand values once per hand? (as in, we don't print the hand value until the player stops asking for cards or busts, and same for the dealer)</p>

print order</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Re: your first question, yup. You just print the totals for each player after he/she stops getting dealt cards. This is assuming that you make it to that point in the game, though; if the player is dealt a natural 21, you immediately announce it and move on, disregarding the dealer's total. Then, if the player busts, you announce his/her total, deduct the wager from the bankroll, and move on - so in that case you wouldn't need to announce the dealer's total either.</p>

<p>Also, if my understanding of the order in the spec is correct, for the very beginning of the game you shuffle first before announcing "Hand 1", etc - this follows what's in the given .out file. But after that, if you shuffle again (when the deck reaches fewer than 20 cards), you first announce the hand and bankroll, and then do the shuffling/announcing. So out of the two examples you gave, it'd be the former. I say this because of the way the spec lists the flow of control in the driver: first, it says to announce the hand, and after that it says "if there are fewer than 20 cards left in the deck, reshuffle..."</p></TEXT>

<p>if you have worked together at all (you helped them or they helped you) on the project you NEED to say that he is your partner, and then the autograder will just take the last submission from either of you to be graded.</p>

<p>also if you have already submitted once with partner.txt with their name in it as well then you are officially partners for the project</p>

<p>maybe you should try to find a new partner for project 5 so paired programming actually works or just go at it alone.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>just to follow up the point of allowing partners for the projects is for you use paired programming where both of you are sitting down together at the same computer and coding together so you can talk about each part and explain to each other why something should be a certain way. This has been shown in many studies to increase learning and retention of programming knowledge.</p></TEXT>

<p>In one of my hand_tests I am using asserts to check whether or not the hand is soft or hard.</p>
<p>Ex.</p>
<p>Hand H;</p>
<p>assert(H.hand_is_soft());</p>
<p>assert(!H.hand_is_soft());</p>

<p>But I am getting this compile error for the lines with the asserts,</p>
<p>"void value not ignored as it ought to be"</p>
<p>??? Any idea what this means? </p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Try using ==true or ==false?</p>

<p>Did you remember #include &lt;cassert&gt;?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Now that I'm looking at it, you probably implemented hand_is_soft() as a void instead of a bool function by accident....</p>

<p>http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/unices/13109/</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's weird because in my Hand file it returns a bool. It works for all my other tests when I do the assert(hand_is_soft()), but not my last one.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Wild guess: you are asserting (not H).hand_is_soft, you should assert not (H.hand_is_soft)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I've tried those, and I've included &lt;cassert&gt;.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Diff Outputs</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe that is an honor code violation...</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How can you diff outputs if you aren't sharing test code? You can only work on testcases with your partner.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No, this isn't allowed. The idea is that to "give the same inputs to the driver and compare your outputs" is, in a sense, sharing testing data. In industry you will be working on your own project and won't be able to ask to run your code against your friends, as they won't be working on your project. This is an exercise to not only learn how to code, but how to test, and filtering through your output and finding incorrect output is part of this process. Oh the joy of testing!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe what they are asking is can you test outputs from the driver as in you both give the same inputs to the driver and compare your outputs.</p>

<p>I think the question is whether this is allowed.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have nevered used reset() function in my driver's program.What is it used for?</p></TEXT>

Description of Test Cases</TEXT>

<p>I know we're all engineers here, but grammar is always nice. The people reading your overview should be able to actually comprehend what you're trying to say.</p></TEXT>

<p>My question is do we even need complete sentences for our descriptions?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think you'll be OK if you have 4 sentences instead of 3, but I can't promise anything. Please use correct grammar in your test descriptions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The spec says something like "approximately three sentences" somewhere. We really just want you guys to not write like a paragraph for every test. Keep it short and sweet and to the point. Besides, writing more is more effort, and who wants that :)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When did anyone say we were allowed 3 sentences max? I don't see it in the spec...</p></TEXT>

<p>I can't compile my test because I get this error. I'm using the make Hand_Test00.cpp command in the terminal and I am including Hand.h in my test file. this is my Hand.cpp:</p>

<p>Your tests case looks fine, but I'm seeing a number of issues with your Hand.cpp and I'm not sure what issue you're particularly wondering about.</p>
<p>1. you need to include "Card.h"</p>
<p>2. in your switch statement, you're missing the scope operator on TWO, THREE, FOUR, etc.</p>
<p>3. you never declared the variable "x" in your add_card function</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback. But I'm still confused about the undefined reference. The error says undefined reference to "Hand::Hand()" and the other functions in Hand.cpp. I fixed the problems you mentioned and included Card.h. But I didn't think I had to because Hand.h includes Card.h</p></TEXT>

<p>When you use the function get_rank, it returns a value that is not truly representative of the Card's actual rank. For example, if you call get rank of a Two, it returns 0 because of enum layout of the array of card ranks. Should we be creating a helper function that returns card's actual rank by calling get_rank and adding 2? In other words, will we get points of if we say:</p>
<p>if (c.get_rank() == 0)</p>
<p>when we're really checking if the card's rank equals 2? Is 0 in this case considered an "unexplained" or "magic number"</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
getting a card's rank</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You shouldn't compare enums to integers. I believe you will get a compiler error if you do that. Instead, you should be doing</p>
<p>if(c.get_rank() == Card::TWO) </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Not OP</p>

<p>As a aside: I didn't get a compiler error. I compared it to the value in an array (like he said, it was 0). That's how Idid all my get_ranks(). I would just compare 2 less than the actual value..<br /><br /><br /></p>
<p>so for eight I would compare it to 6 etc etc..</p>

<p>Is that not okay?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I did that. But you may as well just do what the instructor says because its pretty easy to fix. I changed it in like, a minute. Better safe than sorry. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Think about what happens with face cards if you just add two: what is a king worth, and what will your function treat it as being worth?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So in add_card, can we just add 2 to the value returned by get_rank (to get the correct value to be added to the hand value)?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>EDIT: Updated the title</p>

<p>In other words, how long until the autograder (or person grader) gets sick of letting the test cases, cuts it off, and says it's a failure?</p>

<p>I ask, as my player test just for counting takes about... 13^2*~10000000 + 13^4*10000000 computations. Basically, I'm testing every darn possibility on multiple levels. In other words, for every possible exposing set of cards of size n (which has 13^n possibilities), do either one set of 10000000 or another 10000000 tests (based off of the player's count). Oh, and plus another set of tests for something else.</p>

<p>Too much fun with for loops. At the moment, I have a bug and just letting it cout a little bit of information for every test (~3 couts) as I have some sort of error (either in Player.cpp or in my tests). Without couting, the process as is takes only &lt;6 seconds.

 <TEXT>
<p>As long as you want</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When I wrote on the 101th, I meant just as an abstract example. I have no idea what bug that is.</p>

<p>I guess I'll go with the common, corner, and stress (of sorts) tests. And yeah, I think sanity (and the autograder) will stop me from going overboard. It takes about 2000*(13+13^2+13^3+13^4) seconds (which is up from 6 seconds just by running 3 couts every test). Pretty sure they won't allow this as this would take way too much time on the autograder (as it wouldn't really know if there's an infinite loop by then), and no one wants to test this via hand.</p>

<p>Ah well. Lesson learned.Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is the infamous 101 card reset bug a problem that you ran into (or could run into) while programming the player?  If not, then you (probably) don't need to test for it.  Just go for the common tests, the corner tests, and stress tests when applicable.  Not that I can stop you from going overboard on your testing, but there might be a more sensible test that will also catch your error.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You are the one creating the code, and thus, should have a pretty solid understanding as to what should be tested. For example, will testing every single possible combination of the first 4 dealt cards (2 for you, 2 for dealer) necessary? I sure hope not! Be thorough, yet mindful, there is no need to create a 30 second loop when 5 lines will test the same thing (which happens quite often)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have three questions regarding the dealer:</p>

<p>1. If the dealer gets a natural 21, do we have to print out "Dealer dealt natural 21\n"?</p>
<p>2. If the dealer gets a natural 21, does the player lose 3/2 of his/her wager or just his wager?</p>
<p>3. If the dealer's dealt hand is already over 17 but is not a natural 21, so he does not hit at all, is his hole card exposed?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Dealer questions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>1) No</p>
<p>2) Pretty sure just his wager</p>
<p>3) Expose hole card, no hit.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Read the spec</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Just to clarify, for point number 2: if the dealer gets a natural 21, but the player also gets a 21 after drawing some number of cards (a "non-natural 21", so to speak), then it's a push and the bankroll doesn't change.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Because the two totals are the same, this is a push</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But if a player gets a 21 whether natural or not doesn't player win?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Not necessarily. If a player get a natural 21, then they get the 3/2 payoff immediately without the dealer even playing, so in that case they win automatically. But if a player gets 21 after drawing some cards (a non-natural 21), then there's still the possibility of a push. If the player stands on 21, then the dealer happens to also get 21, then neither wins.</p></TEXT>

<p>Yup. In the spec it says that the Counting player "counts cards in addition to playing the basic strategy", so the only main difference between Simple and Counting is the latter's card counting. Otherwise, they choose to hit or stand using the same strategy.</p></TEXT>

How to test the factory function?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well you expect the factory to return a specific player pointer, so that might be a good place to start.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Test and make sure that the player behaves like a simple player. That's really the only way to see what kind of player you got.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm a little confused about this as well. I know that calling the factory function will return a pointer to a simple player (when I tell it to create a simple player). However, how do I actually check this address? For instance, I call my simple player alice_simple in Player.cpp. In my test case, I can't assert the address of the simple player I just created with &amp;alice_simple since alice_simple only exists in Player.cpp</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In our Player.cpp, do we first declare our classes and then below all that do the implementations, or can we simply do that all at once? </p>

<p>In other words, (simplified example) do we write it like</p>
<pre>class Simple: public Player
{
   public:
    int bet(unsigned int bankroll, unsigned int minimum);
};<br /><br />//counting and competitor<br /><br />int Simple::bet(unsigned int bankroll, unsigned int minimum)<br />{<br />	//implementation<br />}</pre>
<p>or can we just write</p>

<pre>class Simple: public Player
{
   public:
    int bet(unsigned int bankroll, unsigned int minimum)
    {
        //implementation
    }<br />};<br /><br />//counting and competitor</pre>


<p>Additionally, if a function definition doesn't change across players, do we need to re-implement the functions with the same code, or can we just omit them?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Player implementations</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Because a lot of the player functions are pretty short, you can go ahead and implement the functions inside of the player class. However, if the implementation starts to become too long (somewhere along the 8-10 lines case), then it would make the code more readable if you define the function outside of the class.</p>

<p>As for the re-implementation question, this is the beauty of inheritance and virtual functions. You can just omit them, but make sure you understand why by reviewing the lecture slides. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The second way. And don't re-implement the same code</p></TEXT>

<p>Say for example, our player has 18 total and the dealer has three aces and a 4, most players would count it as a seven and hit again but our dealer stays because he already counted it as soft and has 17. Is this correct? Does he just lose? Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Reverting to hard Ace?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As per spec:</p>
<p>The dealer must hit until he either reaches a total greater than or equal to 17 <strong>(hard or soft)</strong></p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If possible, count all aces as soft until you have to revert them back to hard (i.e. keeping them soft would make you bust)</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks! So that means if the dealer has the potential to reach 17 he stays even if it would advantageous to count his three aces as 1 and keep hitting to try and beat the player? So if he had an Ace and a Six he'd stay no matter what and not try and be risky? Sorry, if this is the same question I was pretty confident and then I started thinking too much haha</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>We have already implemented (blank) all pure virtual functions in SimplePlayer (tried the destructor too) and then Counting/Competitor have special functions implemented for expose and shuffled - we haven't declared anything else virtual.</p>

<p>In the spec, it states:</p>
<p>Since each of your implementation (.cpp) files will be graded separately by compiling it with our</p>

<p>depends on another one of your files. For example, do not write an extern function in Hand.cpp that</p>
<p>you use in Player.cpp.</p>

<p>This slipped my mind and in my Deck.cpp I have the following code segment:</p>
<pre>int suit = Card::SPADES;</pre>

<p>Is this considered unacceptable because it's referencing something from Card.cpp? I use the Card:: scope resolution in my Hand.cpp as well.</p></TEXT>

File inter-dependencies</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In @1977, the TA posted that using c.get_rank() == Card::SUIT works for use in a function in Player.cpp.</p>

<p>This isn't inter-file dependence. I think it's fine. You are expecting that Card.cpp is implemented correctly, which is acceptable. </p>

<p>Isn't inter-file depence where you create another, unknown function in Card.cpp and use THAT in another file? </p>

<p>Could be wrong, but yeah.</p></TEXT>

Declaring a player variable</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Did you write player_factory?</p>
<p>If (yes) -&gt; did you implement it correctly and assign Player pointers to a generic variable of class type Simple, Counting, or Competitive?</p>
<p>If (no) -&gt; see lecture slides on polymorphism, they cover it</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Assuming that you wrote your SimplePlayer class in <em>Player.cpp</em> as instructed, "no one" (i.e. no code) outside of <em>Player.cpp</em> will be able to directly instantiate a SimplePlayer because the class declaration itself is private to the file.  However, as the student answer pointed out, you can (and should) use the player_factory() function to get the SimplePlayer since player_factory() is in <i>Player.cpp</i> and so has access to the SimplePlayer class.</p>

<pre>Player *p = player_factory("simple");</pre>
<p>If this doesn't make 100% sense, I'd suggest you go through the lecture slides again or talk to a GSI during office hours.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Correct!  But for this project, you <strong>must</strong> declare your Simple, Counting, and Competitive classes within Player.cpp<em>, </em><strong>not</strong> Player.h.  You must not modify Player.h.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I finished the project, but I still don't understand something that should be very obvious. Where in the project did we create the relationship between player and hand? For example, we can use player.hand_value() but it doesn't seem like we ever explicitly say that each player has a designated hand.</p>

<p>Sorry that this is such a stupid question!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
relationship between Player and Hand</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Whoops, never mind! I now realize that we do this in blackjack.cpp. I had been thinking of the hand almost as a private member variable of Player, but now I realize that this isn't the case.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>it probably would have helped if you named the hand object in the driver something else like player_hand or something like that, this way there is a clear distinction between the player object and the hand object</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I just changed the names of my hands to player_hand and dealer_hand to avoid confusion. Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I am having a hard time understanding exactly what is supposed to occur in expose() in the player.cpp.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Expose()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You show the player a card, the player updates count, if applicable.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>expose() is a void function. Don't need to print out anything. Don't need to return anything. For the simple player, there is no implementation inside it. If it is the counting player, you just update the count (you should have a private variable to help keep track).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Your driver program will, at some point, have the dealer deal a card from the deck.  When this happens, expose() is called on your player with said card passed in as an argument.  You don't need to output or return anything, but may have to update a private variable with Counting or do some other calculation in Competitive.</p></TEXT>

<p>how does one "see" the exposed card though? Do we print it out within that function or is "seeing" it just adding it to the count and thats good enough?</p></TEXT>

<p>"Ask the player for a wager and announce it," which I originally interpreted as needing to cin the wager, but you actually already know how the player is going to bet based on the bet function you wrote for each different type of player. Instead of using cin, you need to point to the correct bet function for whichever player is being used and then call that function.</p>

<p>Also check to see what is i the blackjack.out file. If it is an infinite loop, after terminating the program and looking at the file, you will see where the infinite loop was approximately in your file based on what was written there before it got lost infinitely.</p></TEXT>

If we're dealing with a fcn that returns a bool, and we have an if else statement, with the condition being a bool, isn't the 'else' statement not needed? couldn't we just write the if statement, then follow it up with the 'else' part without the 'else' since the only other possible outcome is the opposite bool?  I ask this since I'd like to avoid a compiler error that says I have a void for a non void fcn.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
if else statements and bool conditions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So if you write something like this:</p>

<p>bool bool_func(bool b){</p>
<p>  if(b) return true;</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>The function will not assume that if b == false, you want to return the opposite result. It is possible that if b == false, the function can still return true or false. You can also think about it in terms of truth tables:</p>

<p>true = 1, false = 0</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6px" cellspacing="0" height="93" width="101"><tbody><tr><td>b</td><td>return</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6px" cellspacing="0" height="93" width="101"><tbody><tr><td>b</td><td>return</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Both of these are valid functions (there are others you can have too, like an inverter), so you must have an else statement to indicate which truth table you want.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe you don't need the end "return true" in the first bit of code. One of the statements (if or else) will always evaluate, and both of those have a return.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hmmm, you may be right, I'll have to test it. But I remember typically getting an error when I've done that. I don't think the compiler is smart enough to figure that out (although it seems like it would be pretty "easy")</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But remember....the function is not of type void. The compile will expect there to somehow be a way to get to a return statement with every input possibility. It will be very unhappy without that return true.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Doesn't the else statement cover every other possibility besides (foo == true)?</p>

<p>Also, I tried it without the last return true (so it looks like this):</p>
<pre>using namespace std;<br /><br />bool test(bool b){<br />	if(b) return false;<br />	else return true;<br />}<br /><br />int main(){<br />	test(true);<br />}</pre>
<p>and it compiles and runs.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well, we the reader (or writer) know that a return statement will be reached in the first bit of code without fail. For some reason I thought the compiler didn't make that assumption. Did you compile that with the -Werror, -Wall, and -pedantic flags? If so I must have made a mistake.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ahh...I didn't quite look at your original code carefully enough. How I was interpreting one of the poster's responses was that any of the return true stuff could be eliminated. But yeah, you just need one of the return trues, whether or not you say else.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, I used:</p>

<p>g++ -pedantic -Wall -Werror test.cpp -o test</p>
<p>./test</p>

<p>and both worked</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
ia chiming in: if you have a bunch of if statements and then an else, there won't be a compiler error. if you have a bunch of if statements and then just a return after, you also won't get a compiler error. If, though, you have a bunch of ifs, and to you one of the ifs will always execute, but there is no else or a return after all the if statements, you will get a compiler error because the compiler doesn't know that logically, all of the ifs cover any possible case. it just sees a bunch of ifs and is like "but what happens if none of these ifs executes?!?! then what do you return?!?!" just wanted to make that extra clear for anyone else reading this followup thread :)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If what you're asking is are:</p>
<pre>bool test(bool foo)
{
	if (foo)
	{
		return false;
	}
	else
	{
		return true;
	}
	<span style="text-decoration:line-through">return true; // This is probably what you left out
	// Without it the compiler thinks the function returns void</span><br />	// Just kidding looks like I have no idea what I'm talking about
}</pre>
<p>and :</p>
<pre>bool test(bool foo)
{
	if (foo)
	{
		return false;
	}
	return true;

<p>equivalent, the answer is yes.</p></TEXT>

<p>When i write the test cases for project 4, i donot reimplement the draw for simpler and counting from spec. I just write test cases for both of them since counting is a derived class from simpler.In this case, can I assume it is true that the buggy function given by autograder also does that?So I can only write test cases just for one of them for draw.</p>

 <TEXT>
.h files</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Do you mean creating new .h files for each of your tests? Because if you do mean that, it would mess with the autogravder because it wouldn't know if some students did create new .h files or some didn't. Therefore the precedence for this project was to keep all of the code for your tests in one file.</p>

<p>If instead you mean the issue of which .h files to include in our tests, this is due to what files they will be matched against in the autograder. Don't quote me on this, because I'm not looking at the spec right now, but I recall them matching our deck tests against a working Card implementation and a maybe working Deck implementation, allowing us to #include Card.h and Deck.h in our deck tests. Conversely, for the player tests, they are matched against working Card and Hand implementations and a maybe working Player implementation, meaning we are allowed to #include Card.h, Hand.h, and Player.h. Hope this helps!</p></TEXT>

<p>Well in your Deck_tests, the spec doesn't explicitly say that you will paired with a Player.cpp, so I don't think that it would be ok to include Player.h in those tests. Try taking those out and see if your tests still work correctly.</p></TEXT>

seg fault with command line</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The seg faults I encountered with this project were dealing cards that did not exist. I would look at your shuffle function and look at the RME about what to do if you shuffle when you already have cards dealt out.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well have you made sure to shuffle whenever the deck goes below 20 cards remaining, per the spec? Because if you haven't, you would segfault when the deck hits empty.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have..but I can't think of what else it would be. </p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yup. After 10 or so hands I think you run out of cards (&lt;20) and you have to reshuffle the deck!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would check over your shuffle implementation. Just in case.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the spec, you are supposed to "restore the dec back to its restored state" for shuffle</p>

<p>Doesn't this mean we just change the place where next points to? and put it at the first card in the deck?</p>

<p>I feel like that's it but maybe I am missing something and that's why it is wrong..</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, post shuffle, replace the next pointer at the front of the deck.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
you change the next pointer, yes, but you also have to shuffle. I'd make sure that shuffle doesn't screw with your next pointer after you thought you set it. something like setting next equal to something in one of your loops or something like that.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, i did that D:. (replace the next pointer)</p>

<p>Appreciate your help but yeah.</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>(for some reason, when I cout the number of cards remaining, I get over 110. I feel like this isn't right..I'll look into that).</p></TEXT>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Tests: Simple &amp; Competitor</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would't chance it. Because they are pairing your player_tests with their Player.cpp implementations, your simple and competitor player_tests will go through and in fact tests their correct Simple and Competitor players, meaning the only thing that can come out of it is you asserting that they are wrong, invalidating your file which is testing them. Consequently, this is fine if you separate your tests into files such that a file that tests the simple player <strong>only </strong>tests the simple player and a test that tests the competitor player <strong>only </strong>tests the competitor player, because if they were to get dropped, then you lose nothing in regards to the tests testing the Counting player, the important ones.</p>

<p>Tl;DR : Take em out, or separate em.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
the graders don't run the autograder...like the student said, separating is key. I'm not sure if testing simple player will break the autograder, though. I would email the course staff to get a for sure answer about that.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I was referring to the hand graders looking at the overview file. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I wrote test cases for simple and counting all in separate files (50 of them :O ), and I submitted them all and made sure to explain them in the overview file. So they (the almighty graders) can disregard ones if need be.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Nope. Well you can on your own, and you probably should to be sure your code works, but for the grade, you only need to submit tests for Deck and Counting.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Wait, are we not supposed to write tests for simple? Little confused as to what OP is saying..</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Player.h #includes card.h and hand.h. Shouldn't it only need to #include hand.h, since hand.h #includes card.h? It doesn't really matter, since all of the provided .h files have include guard. However, isn't it still better from a style standpoint to only #include what is necessary?</p></TEXT>

<p>So let's say I split my tests into multiple files and I use assert commands. Dhould I also use a return 0 at the end of my test in main (since in the specs it says to return 0 if true), or is just using the assert commands fine? I guess I don't exactly understand the format for the tests.</p></TEXT>

test files</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Go ahead and put the return 0 at the bottom's to be sure. Can't ever be to safe when we are talking about a no lose situation.</p></TEXT>

main should always always always return 0 before the last curly brace. Asserts throughout your code are expected, so I think you're doing it right :) follow the same style as the tests we gave you and you'll be golden</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>@2023</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Also, another question. I wrote test cases for simple player, counting, and competitor. Is it ok to inlude all of them or should I only include counting player?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is there any reason my partner and I can't create a new hand every different round in blackjack rather than call discard all? I know it may not be the best form, but it's working for me and I can't think of a scenario where it wouldn't. Thank you!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Discard vs. New Hand</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think it works the same way and it should be fine, since discard and the constructor are implemented the same way.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
as long as it works, I don't see why not. Keep in mind that the reason to not do this is it makes your program a bit slower.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
So what if we test shuffle for 10 numbers.  But one of the deck.cpp says like if n = 30, do something bad.  But we don't test that specific number.
Basically, what I am trying to ask is should we literally test every combination?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Tests cases</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As I understand it, the staff/whoever wrote the tests wrote them from the perspective of "So if I was a student and I just read the spec, what could I have misinterpreted?" That and "So if I was a student, what would I be most likely to mess up?" Oh and also corner cases. Lots of corner cases.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Confused as to how our test cases should work. I was originally going to make separate files to test for separate functions for each ADT (i.e. several files testing bet(), several testing draw(), several testing expose()...) but the spec seems to state that our tests will be used to determine whether the entire ADT implementation they're tested against is correct or not.</p>

<p>Does this mean that each file has to test ALL parts of each ADT (all functions) in order to find a bug <em>anywhere</em> in the implementation?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Test Confusion</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Nope. Your first assumption was correct. Your tests can check any part of the implementation, just be sure to cover all of it in the sum total of all of your tests.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>

<p>Since counting player inherets from simple, is it ok to trun in tests for simple player?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>@2023</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, I read that, but my testing simple you are in fact also testing counting, are you not?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Technically, but in that case, you should actually be testing counting and inherently be testing simple.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I guess what I mean to say is that I have quite a few tests for simple player, that counting inherets. Plus a few more for counting. Is this ok, or do I need to do something different</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
well yes, but we don't ask for simple player tests :)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So should I modify my tests then?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't think you need to in this niche case.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm so confused</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm really confused now....I wrote all these simple player cases as well and do I need to go through and take them out now?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
so you can test the inherited functions in simple and assume they're right in counting. HOWEVER, we ask for counting tests, not simple tests. so what you should do is test these inherited functions in counting instead of in simple because you'll get more points that way.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
no? You can test simple all you want. I'm just saying that you should test the inherited functions in counting rather than simple because we grade counting test cases, not simple test cases. all other testing that we don't grade is for your benefit.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
and by inherited functions I mean the ones you wrote in simple and *didn't* overload in counting.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So I wiould have to move all the tests I did for simple into counting to get credit?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I had counting ones too. So as long as I had those I'm okay? I don't need to go through my 70+ cases and remove the simple ones? Some of the cases I repeated for both simple and counting.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is everything that was similar was tested in simple and only the differences were tested in couting. Is this a problem? Do I need to change my tests?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
yes because we only grade test cases for the counting player</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So the main idea is that the more tests you make onto Simple, that wouldn't carry over into Counting, the more chances you have to make a mistake and the more chances you have to get your file thrown out and tests invalidated. So for the most part, try to separate the Simple <strong>only </strong>tests and the Counting <strong>only </strong>tests.</p>

<p>As a corollary, if you are testing Simple for things that you could test Counting for, just switch the player tested on to Counting and this problem will be avoided.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Also, I test specific inputs, such as shuffle 52, etc. Will the tests be looking for specific inputs?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
okay, you will not get credit for simple test cases. if you have simple test cases, you should not delete them as they are for your benefit. Of the test cases that test functions that are in both counting and simple, you should test them for a counting player because we only grade your counting player test cases. it does not matter if you have these test cases repeated for simple and counting, as long as they are at least implemented for counting.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
how do you mean?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As in when I'm testing my shuffle function for example, I don't test every specific input (0-52 and outside cases). I chose a few specific values to test. Is this ok?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
that is exactly how you should be testing your code. test smarter, not all possible inputs. that takes time and effort :)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok. Perfect. And just to clarify. All the tests that I have for simple, I should just change to counitng (use the player factory and point to counting instead) since couting inheriets from simple, rather than testing everything under simple and only testing the new implemntaions for counting?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yup. That'll get you more points!!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
yes</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For the player factory, if the input isn't simple or counting, can we assume it's competitor?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If by this you mean for some sort of if-else construct and are wondering if we need to check for command line errors, we don't.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Perfect!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Wait, so what exactly do we need to test? Just deck, and counting player, correct? All the other tests are for our own benefit?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>As long as you test them elsewhere in your testing files, and you trust those other tests, as you should, yes.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Awesome. Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
kind of? I mean, a wonky player could have other things wrong that aren't exposed when you test draw. I usually make my test cases assuming everything but the thing I'm testing is correct and then try not to use too many other functions besides the one I'm testing. To some level, you can't really help using multiple functions in one test though.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah that's why i was wondering</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Say I'm testing draw() in my file, am I allowed to assume that all the other functions besides draw will be correct in the implementation?</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
different cards output</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Cards and all should be the same. If your cards are different, but all of your scores are correct, I would look into your Deck constructor, more specifically on if the right suits are being initialized in the right order.</p></TEXT>

<p>This is just for clarification. If the bankroll value at the command line is less than the required minimum, then the driver should shuffle the deck, then exit with "Player has ____ after 0 hands." Is this correct?</p></TEXT>

<p>I've been working on a seg fault for a long long long time. What confuses me about it is that the seg fault is happening after the return of a void function, and when I comment out all other code except for the function I'm looking at it still seg faults, and when i run gdb it never hits the seg fault and ends up at the return 0 in main.</p>

<p>The seg fault happens after shuffle_cut():</p>
<pre>void shuffle_cut(Deck &amp; deck) {
	cout &lt;&lt; "Shuffling the deck\n";
	//int cut1 = get_cut();
	int cut1 = 39;
	deck.shuffle(cut1);
	cout &lt;&lt; "cut at " &lt;&lt; cut1 &lt;&lt; endl;
	//int cut2 = get_cut();
	int cut2 = 22;
	deck.shuffle(cut2);
	cout &lt;&lt; "cut at " &lt;&lt; cut2 &lt;&lt; endl;
	//int cut3 = get_cut();
	int cut3 = 33;
	deck.shuffle(cut3);
	cout &lt;&lt; "cut at " &lt;&lt; cut3 &lt;&lt; endl;
	//int cut4 = get_cut();
	int cut4 = 37;
	deck.shuffle(cut4);
	cout &lt;&lt; "cut at " &lt;&lt; cut4 &lt;&lt; endl;
	//int cut5 = get_cut();
	int cut5 = 38;
	deck.shuffle(cut5);
	cout &lt;&lt; "cut at " &lt;&lt; cut5 &lt;&lt; endl;
	//int cut6 = get_cut();
	int cut6 = 37;
	deck.shuffle(cut6);
	cout &lt;&lt; "cut at " &lt;&lt; cut6 &lt;&lt; endl;
	//int cut7 = get_cut();
	int cut7 = 38;
	deck.shuffle(cut7);
	cout &lt;&lt; "cut at " &lt;&lt; cut7 &lt;&lt; endl;
	return;
}
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	/*int bankroll = atoi(argv[1]);
	int hands = atoi(argv[2]);
	Player * p = player_factory(argv[3]);
	*/
	Hand player_hand;
	Hand dealer_hand;
	Deck deck;
	shuffle_cut(deck);
	cout &lt;&lt; "after shuffle";</pre>
<p>(my shuffle_cut() looks like that to compare my program to the file we were given)</p>
<p>"after shuffle" never executes, but in gdb each call to shuffle doesn't cause a seg fault, and the 7th cut is printed.</p>

<p>I did have a lot of trouble writing shuffle, but the tests that I've run on it have worked so far. Here is shuffle:</p>
<pre>void Deck::shuffle(int n) {
	if ((n == 0) || (n == DECK_SIZE)) { //if n is 0 or 52, no shuffling occurs
		return;
	}
	Card cardsLeft[DECK_SIZE];
	Card cardsRight[DECK_SIZE];
	int i = 0;
	while (i &lt; n) { //creates "left deck" with n cards
		cardsLeft[i] = cards[i];
		++i;
	}
	int j = 0;
	while ((j + i) &lt; DECK_SIZE) { //creates "right deck" with rest of cards
		cardsRight[j] = cards[j + i];
		++j;
	}
	int k = 0;
	int o = 0;
	int cardsLeftDelt = 0;
	int cardsRightDelt = 0;
	if (n &lt; (DECK_SIZE - n)) { //if the left deck is smaller
		while (cardsLeftDelt &lt; n) {
			//go back and forth between decks until left is out
			if ((k % 2) == 0) {
				cards[k] = cardsRight[o];
			}
			else {
				cards[k] = cardsLeft[o];
				++cardsLeftDelt;
				++o;
			}
			++k;
		}
		o = 0;
		while (k &lt; DECK_SIZE) { //when left deck runs out, rest is right
			cards[k] = cardsRight[k];
			++k;
		}
	}
	else { //if the right deck is smaller
		while (cardsRightDelt &lt; (DECK_SIZE - n)) {
			//go back and forth between decks until right is out
			if ((k % 2) == 0) {
				cards[k] = cardsRight[o];
				++cardsRightDelt;
			}
			else {
				cards[k] = cardsLeft[o];
				++o;
			}
			++k;
		}
		o = 0;
		while (k &lt; DECK_SIZE) { //when right deck runs out, rest is left
			cards[k] = cardsLeft[k];
			++k;
		}
	}
	next = &amp;cards[0];

<p>Has anyone else tried looking for a difference in output between counting and simple's bets? I know that counting is supposed to changed his betting strategy if his count gets to 2. But I made them play 10 hands and I'm couting the count at every expose() call and the count literally never gets to 2... in fact it ends up in the negatives for a majority of the time. So there is never a difference in output for me using simple or counting. I have the count reset every time the deck is shuffled (which is rarely) and I know I'm adding/subtracting the count at the right times because I'm following the count line by line using cout. Is this supposed to be happening?</p></TEXT>

<p>In the spec, it says that the simple player will always bet the minimum. The counting player also always bets the minimum if count &lt; 2. It doesn't mention anything about the case where the minimum is higher than the bankroll until the driver program section. So when testing Player.cpp, if the minimum is higher than the bankroll, will the bet function still return the minimum, or does it not matter?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Player bet when minimum wager &gt; bankroll</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The requires clause for the bet function is that bankroll is greater than or equal to the minimum, so I don't think you have to worry about that in creating the players' strategy since that's consistent with the instructions for the driver</p></TEXT>

<p>So i coded cards remaining on my computer and then my partner edited it because for some weird reason just doing DECK_SIZE + cards-next did not give the right number of cards. So he had to subtract by 128 for it to work. Now when i tried it on my computer i had to change that to 112. Is there anyway for me to make sure that this number doesn't keep changing? could you let me know what I'm doing wrong? </p>
<p><br />The other thing I found is that when I call cards_remaining in my test file it seems like I have to add 112 for it to give me the right number? And i am really confused as to why I have to adjust the same function even though it works in file and it doesnt in the other :/</p>

<pre>int Deck::cards_remaining() const
{ 
  /*cout &lt;&lt; next &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; cards &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; DECK_SIZE + (cards-next)&lt;&lt; endl;*/

so here's a hint next - beginning gives you the number of cards already dealt and we know how many total cards there are, then we can do some simple subtraction to find how many cards have not be dealt yet
you have the right idea but your math is wrong this you need some weird correcting number</TEXT>

<p>Ok the problem was resolved. I basically had a shuffle function in blackjack.cpp that returned a deck. I should have passed by pointer instead because the deck it returned was a new deck in a different memory location. which caused it to give me some random crazy number.</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>ok so thats basically what I had but the problem seems to be when  shuffle. It seems like the position of next just changes completely each time I shuffle even though the only statement involving next in that function, is</p>

<p>next = &amp;cards[0];</p>

<p>any suggestions as to how I can assign next to the first card of the shuffled deck, without increasing the memory value?</p></TEXT>

<p>Yes, since you're dividing up your test cases into multiple files, they'll presumably test different things, so not all of them would find every error. What matters is that between all the files, the error is found at least once.</p></TEXT>

<p>If both the player and dealer are dealt a natural 21, wouldn't we never know about the dealer since we just proceed with the next hand once we know the player has a natural 21?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Player and Dealer both dealt natural 21</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the case of a Player natural 21, even if the dealer also would have had 21, the player wins the natural 21 payoff. This is the only time that the same hand values don't result in a Push.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If the player gets a natural 21, dealer doesn't play, player wins (you wouldn't even need to output "player wins").... BUT we do reach a point when player continues to be dealt "hits" based on his strategy and ends up with a 21, then dealer would show his hole card and it would be dealers turn to hit or what not to determine if Player would win or if it would be a push.</p>

<p>I hope that helps. It took me some time to understand this as well.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p></TEXT>

<p>Would I have to make competitor be a derived class of Simple, and copy paste the expose and shuffled code?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Competitor get_count()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can just make a private variable in the Competitor class named count.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
why would you make another variable that's the same as an inherited one? 
you can use get-count in other member functions in competitor you just can't use it outside of the class so try to think of how to modify count inside a member function you can use outside of the class</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>no keep it private and make the setter and getter of count protected, that is a much better way of designing the class</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So basically just make count protected?</p></TEXT>

I recall there being an email about pre- and post-lab surveys for a prior lab, and I did not receive those emails either. Thus, my email is probably not on the email list for lab survey emails.

<p>In the spec for the rules of an ace (if any) being hard, it says if the player's hand totals 11 or less , he always hits."</p>

<p>Is this scenario of the hand total is less than 11 with a hard ace ever even possible?</p>

<p>For example, for the ace card to be more advantageous for the either player, it would be assigned 11 (soft) off the bat if total hand count is still under 21. For any situation when total hand count goes over 21 and ace is still 11(soft), then ace would turn to hard (1). 22 is the lowest number to bust, thus 22 - 11 = 11 means the other non-ace cards add up to 11 and we cannot change these values. Thus, soft ace changed to hard ace would lead to 22-11+1= 12. </p>

<p>Another example, if two aces are the first two dealt cards to the player, then total hand count would be 12 to be more advantageous to the player. Thus, hand count less than 11 will a hard count could not apply here. </p>

<p>...I just can't think of an example where this specification would be true and I am not sure how to go about it for writing a test case.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Hard count</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I can't see any situation in which it would be more advantageous, besides which my implementation of Hand prevents that situation from occurring anyway -- but I implemented that portion of draw() as provided in the specs anyway, just in case.  It seemed safer.</p>

<p>-----</p>
<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Don't forget that the ace itself is not what is hard or soft. The hand is either hard or soft. Since a hand is soft only if it includes an ace counted as 11, and hard otherwise. A hand with no aces at all is a hard hand. Therefore, a hand consisting of only the two and three of spades would be considered a hard hand, and would fall under the category of 11 or less in value. So while you will never have a hard hand with less than 11 points that includes an ace, you may have a hard hand that is less than 11 points with no aces.</p></TEXT>

<p>Since we're testing bet based on expose, testing expose based on bet and testing shuffled based on expose and bet, does that mean that if bet is buggy, all these tests including expose and shuffled would fail? Or is it considered false negatives?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Test bet, expose and shuffled dependency</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>They'll be testing their entire Player.cpp's with your tests. So, if there is a bug at all, there is no false negative. Iff expose() and shuffled() are both buggy, then bet should fail as well appropriately (in some cases at least).<br /><br />They - or you - won't test expose() and shuffled() directly, as both functions provide no means to see exactly what happens before and after those functions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My suggestion is to test the different aspects of bet:</p>

<ol><li>First test bet's base behaviour: Make sure bet is between minimum and bankroll, inclusive</li><li>Then test the counting player's two categories of bet behaviours:<ol><li>Count &lt; 2: Bet should be same as minimum, no matter what value (so, test expose and shuffle here. Then throw many, many values for minimum + bankroll, and they all should return minimum)</li><li>Count &gt;= 2: Bet should do two things for the SAME exposed cards: [like above, throw many, many values for minimum + bankroll and they should all behave as if count &gt;=2, namely should be only one of two below cases] [You can do varying levels of tests- for example, make sure bet &gt; minimum if minimum != bankroll and so on]<ol><li>Case 1: Minimum*2 &gt;= Bankroll: Return bankroll</li><li>Case 2: Minimum*2 &lt; Bankroll: Return minimum*2</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>
<p>As you can see from above, you try to expose certain cards to the player (and do all sorts of different cards) while keeping your own count. If you believe the count &gt;= 2, test one way (and test a ton that way as well for just those cards). Otherwise, test bet the other way.</p>

<p>Hope that helps. It's testing upon more testing.</p></TEXT>

<p>(And just to be clear, you'll have two levels of tests: One is exposing certain cards and also doing shuffled() each time. The other is testing bet with many, many values. However, with only bet() can you determine if there's an error, so you really can't tell which one of the three functions caused the bug without further debugging.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the instructors use your test functions, they're looking only if your tests say its buggy or not. They're not trying to debug their code with your tests. Simply, the tests are just there to tell you if there is a bug at all.)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What if expose and shuffled are correctly implemented, but bet is buggy? For example, if the range to determine when to multiply the minimum is wrong? Does that mean my expose and shuffled tests are giving false negatives? Or is there any other ways to test them?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Can we assume that the .h files will be correct when testing? For instance, all the function names and input/output types will be valid, only the implementations will be incorrect?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
.h files in testing</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I suppose an instructor confirmation would be best, but just going off the spec I think so. It says that our tests will be linked against possibly incorrect Deck.cpp's and Player.cpp's, meaning that the bugs are going to be in the ADT implementations, not their respective header files.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So I've read through the Piazza posts and I still don't know if I've implemented my get_rank() function properly. All I do is: return rank;</p>
<p>I account for the fact that the number this produces is 2 less than the rank later in the files by adding 2 to the values</p>
<p>However, I do compare cards by using get_rank() == Card::TWO for example</p>
<p>Is this incorrect?</p>
<p>I don't want to change this because then I'm worried if I don't simple return rank I won't be able to compare cards in the get_rank() == Card::TWO way</p>
<p>I just don't know if this would properly pass the instructors' test cases</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
get_rank()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>All you do is return rank. It's just a way for a non member function to access rank.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>keep get rank simple, follow the RME of the functions, if you don't the autograder will tell you it's wrong</p>
<p>and maybe where you need to value of the rank you can make a small helper function that takes in rank enum and returns what the value should be, that's how's I do it</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the spec it states: "be sure to expose() any face-up cards to the player." for the initial Deal.</p>

<p>Does this mean expose all face-up cards dealt (including the one to the dealer) or expose JUST the face-up cards dealt to the player?</p>

<p>thanks!</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
What upcards will the player use expose()?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Expose <strong>all</strong> face-up cards dealt in the game, regardless of who receives the cards. This is so the Counting player can have the most accurate count possible. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>think of expose as the player seeing all the cards that have been played, the player can see all the face up cards on the table but can't see what a face down card is until it's turned over</p></TEXT>

<p>Yep. Doesn't matter.</p></TEXT>

<p>I did that in the context given in your example. Do I need to do that every time I call a function from a different file?</p></TEXT>

<p>Whenever it involves something declared inside a class (not necessarily a different file), yes.</p></TEXT>

<p>Just updated all my code to account for this, same errors.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>We had a similar problem at first. It turned out we forgot to include card.cpp, hand.cpp, and deck.cpp in the compile line. Perhaps this is your problem as well. Hope this helps.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Everything is in one directory, including my terminal.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>make sure you are compiling all the necessary .cpp files in your compile command</p>

<p>for instance if you needed to run a deck test then you should compile both Deck.cpp and Card.cpp</p></TEXT>

<p>For the instructors: I opened an instructor-only post in which I shared my code, compile line, and errors, if that would be more helpful.</p></TEXT>

Do we need rmes for counting, simple and competitive?</TEXT>

<p>I don't think so, unless you somehow created new member functions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you should do RME's for any new functions you made, and if you are over riding any functions you should update the RME's to accurately reflect what the function does for that class.</p>

<p>also not a bad idea of having a comment on what the class does and what it represents</p></TEXT>

<p>Sorry for the long post. TL;DR at end.</p>
<p>I am encountering a large bug where I cannot compile my project due to undefined references, despite #including all relevant .h files, using the scope operator as needed, and typing exactly the given command line.</p>

<p>The two files that seem to be the problem are blackjack.cpp and Player.cpp, so I am providing their code in the full.</p>

<p>I have no idea what is wrong. Everything seems right. I also opened the public thread "#include does nothing" and have tried the solutions my classmates suggested; they do not work.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>UPDATE: this seems to be happening with my deck test cases as well, so here is their significantly shorter code/errors.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long post.</p>
<p>I am encountering a large bug where I cannot compile my project due to undefined references, despite #including all relevant .h files, using the scope operator as needed, and typing exactly the given command line.</p>

<p>The two files that seem to be the problem are blackjack.cpp and Player.cpp, so I am providing their code in the full.</p>

<p>I have no idea what is wrong. Everything seems right. I also opened the public thread "#include does nothing" and have tried the somlutions my classmates suggested; they do not work.</p></TEXT>

#include problems(?)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
in the meantime, have you tried going to office hours?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm not even sure what this error means much less how to fix it, so feedback would be strongly appreciated. I know it's a lot to read but unless I can fix this I get a 0%</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Resolved.</p>

<p>I didn't realize we had to include the header file in it's respective .cpp (e.g. #include "Hand.h" in Hand.cpp). I thought the compiler was smart enough to link them together based on name.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Does the Counting player use the same draw strategy as Simple player? I just want to make sure.</p></TEXT>

Are we required to test player factory for our countinf player tests?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Player factory testing</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If the factory doesn't work for the counting player, then I imagine the other function tests and asserts are simply going to fail.  Although, I haven't actually tried to return an illegal player.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I suppose I would be curious as to how you would test any players without at least going through the player factory. Because of this, and the fact that there really isn't much to test against it, would it hurt to test it? Don't think of this as what's required to be tested, but what can/ should be tested.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Y'know...for a competitive player strategy.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Are we allowed to #include "Deck.h" and "rand.h" to Player.cpp?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would assume so, if your player looks at the deck and cheats and/or if it behaves randomly.</p></TEXT>

<p>Is the minimum always going to be 5?</p></TEXT>

<p>I heard we are not supposed to add certain .h files in certain .cpp files in project 4. I heard Professor De Orio talk about this during the beginning of lecture but I did not clearly understand why. If we really do not add certain header files in certain .cpp files, which ones exactly do we do that to?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Include header files</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>[has no clue what De Orio said]It's in the spec.  Don't make deck include hand, don't make player tests include deck.[/has no clue what De Orio said]</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The idea is why would certain .cpp files need certain .h files? For example in the student's answer, why would Deck.cpp include Hand.h? Does a hand affect a deck in any way? Does a deck use or implement anything inside of Hand.h? If you answered yes, you may want to double check your logic.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I know from the specs that we stdout what cards are being dealt to the player for the first 2 cards but do we also stdout what he draws after the first 2 also? </p>



</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
anounce cards after 2 initial cards</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, you print any cards that are dealt face up, which includes cards that both players draw.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>^^^^^ the spec and given tests are the true heroes of the projects (and will continue to be in 281)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>While your trying to figure out what to stdout, it may be helpful to look at blackjack_test00.out.correct for outputs along with the specs </p>
<p>^_^</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I want to condense my tests in like 6 files. However, I am not using procedures to split up my tests. Is it ok if test files ignore the &lt;50 lines per function, and keep everything in main?</p>
<p>Or would I be forced to split everything up?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Deck and Player tests</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You should go ahead and split your main up. We set the &lt;50 lines limit to encourage good programming. Several well-named testing functions go a lot further than a single huge main function. </p></TEXT>

<p>And it states there is an "Invalid read of size 1." Does anyone know what causes this problem?</p>

Valgrind</TEXT>

means you accessed memory you don't own. this is what causes a segfault. valgrind should also tell you what line does this.</TEXT>

<p>For sure! Because if the hand implementation we are testing against isn't correct, then your tests caught that bug (even though it's not a bug that you are trying to catch). </p>

<p>When counting how many lines of code make up a function, I know it is common practice to not include lines that are just whitespace, but what about lines that have a single curly brace on them?<br /><br />What standards are we using for this class?<br /><br />Thank you in advance.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
What constitutes line count?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think an instructor's response would be best here, but to my understanding its not so much about the exact number of lines that a functions has, but how much stuff that the code is doing. I think we generally want to keep a code to doing a specific small and decent sized task, making the overall code more cohesive and easier to parse.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
there isn't really a good answer for this because everyone styles their code differently. The best explanation I've heard is "if your code fits on a screen, its good enough." that being said, I'm really bad at following this rule.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
story of my life :) I personally think its a terrible rule for main, but it's also easier to read code with more function calls. I'd say as long as its readable and you don't repeat things all over the place, you should be fine. I can't be 100% sure though since I don't hand grade</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well if that's the rule, then I didn't do that. :-P I have a lot of line breaks for easier readability. Maybe if you deleted those it would fit...</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So I #include "rand.h", but I'm getting an error message about the function being undefined.</p>

<p>The issue is with the makefile compilation. it doesn't compile rand.h. I had manually tried this. I typed "g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -O1 Deck_test03.cpp Deck.cpp Card.cpp rand.cpp -o Deck3" which actually worked fine.</p>

<p>So I'd like to know if this feature can be added to the final grader. I just thought it'd be neat if I can generate a random number to test instead of coming up with a fixed number.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Is there a way to use get_cut() in my test cases?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Soooo the idea behind testing is that you should have complete control of what is happening in the program. Because of that, the whole "randomness in testing" thing isn't really used, as randomness is (obviously) unpredictable.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hey Kris thanks for the answer...</p>

<p>I mean I'm only using it to gimme a number, 'cuz I thought that's fun. But I guess you're right. (But really, get_cut() is only providing an int and in my case I would've been fine with any number between 13 and 39.)</p>

<p>Thanks again!</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Deck Test confusion</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
...you can't test in main if main returns zero. Also, you should follow the RME clauses when testing your program. anything that violates the requires clause is undefined behavior and the users fault. For example, you can only deal 52 cards because the requires clause says that there must be cards left to deal when you call deal().</TEXT>

<p>hi i get a seg fault if i input anything with hands &gt;= 8 e.g. ./blackjack 100 8 counting</p>
<p>however, the segmentation fault always happens at the end of my code</p>
<p>e.g. </p>
<p>Player has 87 after 90 hands<br />Segmentation fault</p>
<p>so it seems like it runs through everything but somehow goes off of memory at the end? i return 0 at the end and everything</p>

<p>and if i use gdb, my program always exits with code01 which I'm assuming is exit(1) which is in the factory function for player.cpp. but i'm definitely putting in "counting" as an input</p>
<p>thanks</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
segmentation fault from hands &gt;= 8</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe after that many hands or so, you have to reshuffle the deck. Maybe make sure you look at the RME for what happens if you shuffle and you've already dealt cards out. You might be dealing cards off the end of the deck array. I encountered a similar issue with a seg fault.</p></TEXT>

when you segfault around returning 0, it means that something is segfaulting when it is being destructed. I'd follow the students advice and take a good look at shuffle and when you're calling shuffle.</TEXT>

I'd honestly use vimdiff here because it highlights things nicely and I have no idea how to use kompare.

Private Deck class in Player class</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>probably would have been OK. we tried to do something similar to what it sounds like you're describing but problems would occur with shuffle. an interesting feature about the shuffle we use is that the shuffling isn't random; it runs through a list of random numbers and that list is the same every time on every computer (as far as we could tell). however, if you made a deck within player and shuffled it every time the real one was shuffled (trying to keep them parallel), rand "knew" when it was called regardless of what file or function it was called from and would then go to the next number from that list. there might be a way to get around this but we didn't know how. the very feature of get_rand() that allowed us to know all the numbers prevented us from using them. of course, you could just hard code a huge amount of the "random" numbers that rand generates but it would eventually run out</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you know the starting address of the deck class in memory you can actually cast the pointer to a fake deck class and you will be able to change the *next pointer of the real deck. I also noticed that if your messing with the next pointer chances are your shuffle function will never be called.</p></TEXT>

Lab10 Output Error</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I found this problem too in my lab. What worked for me was looking back at my copy constructor and making sure to assign my temp array I made on the heap of temp[i] to other.data[i] in my loop. (I originally just had temp[i] = data[i].)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I completed lab10 and I am ready to submit. However, even though I passed all tests and got the correct results, when I run the code in Labster, there remained a deallocated memory location on the heap. When I run the code I found out that at one point memory address 0x9960 is allocated for vec2. So, I went to my code, and added if (capacity &gt; 0) delete[] data; and it fixed the issue. I essentially checked if data was already allocated once, and if it was deallocated it before making a new copy.</p>

<p>However, even though it passes all tests and leaves no memory leak, I don't assume this was the right way to do it. On the other hand, the first code I wrote seemed correct, it passed all tests but there was a memory leak at 0x9960. Did I hit a Labster bug? It doesn't really make sense. Did anyone else have same issue? Thanks.</p>

lab10 question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Are you talking about the assignment operator?  If so, the solution is to always delete[] data before doing the copy, because the object you're assigning to already exists and has a dynamically allocated array that needs to be cleaned up. Your code will probably also work (the if condition will happen to always be true), but conceptually you don't need/want the if.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm a little uncertain on how to submit lab10. In the instruction for submitting, it said: </p>
<p>To turn them in, just copy/paste from Labster into the box on CTools</p>

<p>Are we copying the codes (including all of the functions and main)  from Labster and pasting it to the submission box?</p></TEXT>

<p>I don't understand how this works:</p>

<pre>void IntList::insertFront(int i) {
Node *np = new Node;
np-&gt;datum = i;
np-&gt;next = first;
first = np;

List insertFront()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't understand how this works:</p>

<pre>void IntList::insertFront(int i) {
Node *np = new Node;
np-&gt;datum = i;
np-&gt;next = first;
first = np;
}</pre>
<p>The reason this is confusing to me is because we're telling the node's next pointer to point to first. This works for the first case, but what about when you use insert front again? The new node's next pointer will also point to first, while the original nodes next pointer hasn't been changed and therefore 2 nodes now point to first. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
List insertFront()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>remember that first is just a pointer to what the first node in the list is, if you insert something to the front of the list then your pointer to the first element will change what's it's pointing to. So we need to tell the new front node that it points to the old first node before we assign the pointer first to the new node, if we don't then we lose where the old first node is so can't easily access it anymore. </p>

<p>If you're still confused come to office hours and we can draw pictures for you!!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When we insert a new node at the front of our linked list, we need to set said node's "next" member to point to the next node in the linked list. This is what happens when we use the line "np-&gt;next = first." The node that we insert to the front of the list now has its "next" member pointing to what was previously the first node in the list (as it should be). At this point, we have correctly inserted the node "np" to the front of our list. Well, sort of...</p>

<p>Recall the representation invariants for our IntList class. One of the invariants was that the member variable "first" points to the first node in the linked list. However, we are now breaking this invariant, as the "first" member variable now points to what would be the second node in the list. "first" should point to the node that we just inserted to the front of our linked list. We use the line "first = np" to fix this.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>

Modifying the public interface</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Constructors by their nature should be public, since you need to call them from outside the class if you want a class that's ever going to be constructed. I guess maybe they could be protected in some special cases, but I've never seen it or tried it so take that with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>I think it would be technically correct (my favorite kind of correct) to say that if you define a constructor that takes no arguments you aren't changing the interface, you're just changing the implementation, since there's already a default constructor that takes the same arguments (none). That argument kind of hinges on whether you consider side effects part of the interface or not.</p>

<p>Other than that maybe it's a wording issue with the spec, or some black magic I've never heard of.</p></TEXT>

<p>I was hoping to implement a small helper funtion in one of my Stack_test cases to that would take a Stack as input. I do not wish to modify the Stack passed as input so I therefore do not want to use pass by reference/pointer. I was curious if I will need to utilize a copy construcor or not.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, all of the storage for the Stack class is handled by its private member variable "list." The functions of Stack themselves will not be creating any dynamic variables, but its member functions will make calls to functions in List which will create/destroy dynamic variables. As Stack won't be directly managing any dynamic memory, I thought it might not need a copy constructor.</p>

<p>However, I became confused when I thought about how the member variable "list" which does allocate dynamic memory would be copied without a Stack copy constructor.</p>

<p>To sum up my question: If I have a copy constructor for a member variable of a class, and I am not creating/destroying dynamic variables directly within the class, do I need to create a copy constructor for the class?</p>

<p>I had a pretty hard time trying to explain this, so please let me know if further clarification of my question would be helpful!</p></TEXT>

<p>node_ptr is a member variable of the Iterator class. Since rhs is an Iterator, you want to be using rhs.node_ptr rather than node_ptr.rhs.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This is a special feature of classes in C++. Because rhs is an Iterator and is part of the implementation of a member function of the Iterator class, we have access to rhs's private members.</p>

<p>Note that if rhs was an instance of a different class (which wouldn't actually make sense in the context of the operator overload), we would not be able to access its private members.</p>

<p>Any time you're writing test cases, the first thing to do is to understand what the thing you want to test is supposed to do.

If you're having trouble at this step, come to office hours so we can help you talk through it. </p>

<p>Once you think you completely understand what Iterator does, think of a basic example of Iterator working normally, and use that as your first test case. After you know a normal case, start thinking about weird corner cases--what happens if the list is empty, or if the iterator points to the first node, or the node past the end?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>

<p>first/last and next/prev are correct.</p>

<p>when it goes into the deconstructor the list now looks like </p>
<p>my_list = {2}</p>
<p>first/last and next/prev are now null.</p>

<p>Solving my own question here after some research and asking some folks more knowledgable wrt C++ than me: when you have a class template, an expression like <tt>List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator</tt> is considered to be a dependent type--you're looking up a type an unknown specialization. Consequently, we have to instruct the compiler to defer the lookup of this type.</p>
<p>This is resolved by simply adding <tt>typename</tt> (equivalently, <tt>class</tt> but let's use the most modern C++ we get with CAEN's ancient g++):</p>
<pre>typename List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator it = list.begin(); </pre>

<p>Where should I implement Iterator's public member functions (constructor and four overloaded operators)? Should I implement them where they are declared (that is, inside the Iterator class), or should I declare them in the Iterator class and then implement them at the bottom of List.h?

Insert Front</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Consider the case where you have no elements in the list. At this point, "first" points to 0 (NULL). Now, you insert a new Node into the list. When you make the call "first-&gt;prev = np", the compiler assumes that "first" points to a Node. However, "first" actually points to 0, which has no member "prev". I believe this may be causing your seg fault.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>for insert_back() are you correctly inserting a node into an empty list where you set both first and last to the node?

 <TEXT>
<p>We implemented an if statement inside of insertFront and the segfault was taken care of.</p>

<p>if (this-&gt;isEmpty())<br />    {   <br />        last-&gt;next = np;<br />    }   </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>have you run it through a debugger with multiple inserts and see when you get the seg fault and what line is causing it?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is there a good way to keep track of list size?</p>

<p>I don't think you can simply use pointer arithmetic (ie. last-first) because if you insertFront(), you technically are inserting at an address location behind the last element, aren't you?</p>

<p>For example, say first points to 0x1 and last points to 0x1 when you have one element.</p>

<p>If you insertFront, the second node will be at the next spot, 0x2. So first will now point to 0x2 and last will point to 0x1.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
List size() function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
You are correct in noting that pointer arithmetic does not work here. Recall that you can add elements to the middle of the list as well using an iterator. Somewhat related to that, you do then have a way to traverse the list using our forward direction iterator. You can as such keep a counter of how many nodes you've "visited" -- in other words, the size of the list.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you are correct in saying that you can't use pointer arithmetic to calculate size, unlike arrays, linked lists do not have to be contiguous in memory because they are just a bunch of node objects that point to each other.</p>

<p>but you could go through until you hit the end and see how many nodes there are (this is unfortunately one of the draw backs of using a linked list, but you make up for it with quick inserts!)</p>

<p>You'll learn all about the positives and negatives of different data structures in 281!!!!!!!! </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you did that you would have to remember to adjust size in every member function that you implement (insert, remove, etc) which makes it easier to make mistakes and miss something.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is there anything wrong with creating a private member variable to hold the size? Since we have control of the .h file and we aren't changing the public interface, doesn't that mean we can create a member variable that just holds the size?</p></TEXT>

Where to write our function implementations</TEXT>

For List and Stack, yes. For the compiler to be able to create the classes from the class templates for a given type, it needs to have the implementations available. So, the implementation is put in the header file to be available wherever the class template could be used.</TEXT>

<p>Note that the object at the first element did not change. It is the same object that remained there, but because we had a reference to it, we were able to call a member function and modify its contained <tt>int</tt> without creating a new object.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, this seems to be a mistake.</p>
<p>The important part to know is that if you do <tt>stack.push(stack.pop());</tt> the stack will remain equivalent, though because <tt>Stack&lt;T&gt;::push()</tt> is <tt>void</tt> you cannot get the item this way.</p>
<p>Likewise for <tt>Stack&lt;T&gt;::top()</tt> the function cannot be called in the way shown, but important is that it does return a <em>reference</em> to the top item.</p>
<p>Here's a little code sample illustrating the intended behavior of returning a reference and modifying the first element:</p>
<pre>class BoxedInt {
    int member;
public:
    BoxedInt() : member(0) { }
    void set(int a) { member = a; }
    int get() const { return member; }
};<br /><br />int main() {<br />    Stack&lt;BoxedInt&gt; s;<br />    s.push(BoxedInt());<br />    s.push(BoxedInt());<br />    // at this point, the stack is [0, 0] (top value shown first)<br />    s.top().set(9999);<br />    // at this point, the stack is [9999, 0] (top value shown first)<br />    return 0;<br />}</pre>
<p>Important to note is that the object at the first element did not change. It is the same object that remained there, but because we had a reference to it, we were able to call a member function and modify its contained <tt>int</tt> without creating a new object.</p></TEXT>

<p>Will the function pointers &amp; functors that are passed to count_if() only take one datum argument?

count_if()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From the effects clause, "[<tt>Stack::count_if()</tt>] returns the number of elements in the stack for which <tt>f(datum)</tt> is true" which implies that it is a unary function (i.e. takes one argument).</p>

<p>But just in case that argument doesn't totally satisfy you, do note that you are both the implementer as well as the consumer of this function.</p>
<p>Looking further into the spec (and the header files for the later components of the project) you'll find it's useful particularly in one case: the 'm' command of the RPN calculator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are not allowed to actually pop all the elements off the stack to implement this (you can only pop the top value).

<p>If you want to compare each element of the stack against a constant, would this be a unary or binary function? If your first answer is binary, could you find a way to make it a unary function?

I am looking at list_compile_check.cpp and it makes a list, my_list, fills it with 42s then empties it calling removeFront and removeBack.  At this point first and last both point to 0 because it's an empty list.  Then an iterator, iter, is created by setting iter = my_list.begin().  my_list.begin() returns 0 because my_list is empty, so iter points to 0.  Then my_list.insert(iter,42) is called which inserts one element--42--into my_list, but iter still points to 0.  Then my_list.erase(iter) gives me an error: "Access violation reading location 0x00000004.
Where am I going wrong here?  I feel like iter should point to the first item (which would be 42) but it still points to 0.  I can't just set iter to the first item in the list because it is passed by value.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
insert</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Using insert() puts the inserted element before the iterator's position, but the iterator will still "point" to the same place in the list. In this case, the behavior you're seeing is correct since the iterator is still pointing "past the end".</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I have a follow-up regarding List_compile_check.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before this block of code executes, my_list is an empty list.</p>
<pre>List&lt;int&gt;::Iterator iter = my_list.begin();
my_list.insert(iter, 42);
my_list.erase(iter);
//some other stuff (not important here)
++iter;</pre>
<p>iter is set to the beginning of the list, which is null since the list is empty. Then a call to insert and erase is made, but iter still points to null; specifically, it points to one "past the end" of a list containing only the element 42. The overloaded ++ operator is then called on iter, but I put an assert in the overloaded ++ operator function requiring that an Iterator's node_ptr member must point to a valid Node (meaning non-null) in order for the ++ operation to work. Thus, the assert stopped my program at that point.</p>
<p>Is this a valid assumption to make? Can we assume a requirement to calling Iterator's overloaded ++ operator (as well as the overloaded * operator) is that node_ptr must point to a valid Node? If so, why is List_compile_check breaking this requirement? If not, how are we to handle ++iter and *iter when they point to an empty list or one past the end?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I am wondering the same thing.</p>

 <TEXT>
Stack</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Stack is a wrapper class for list, this means that we are essentially using a list but we make it so the list is being used in a very specific way and in no other way, i.e only being able to push elements onto the list on one side and only being able to pop the most recently pushed element. So yes in many ways the Stack class and the List class are similar.</p>

<p>for a doubly linked list we can insert elements either in the front or the back at any time, but for the purposes of the calculator we don't want to be able to do that so we make the Stack wrapper class so the only way you can interact with the elements in the list is the correct way for the caluculator</p></TEXT>

Do not change the public interface of List, although you<br />// may add the Big Three if needed.  <strong>Do add the public member functions for</strong><br /><strong>// Iterator.</strong>" statement?

Defining Iterator public functions</TEXT>

<p>If there is only one element in the node, do first and last both point to that one element? or does last or firstpoint to null?</p></TEXT>

one element in the list</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't have an instructor confirmation on this, but I think it makes most sense in a one-element list to have first and last point to that element, because that one element is both the first and the last item in the list.</p>

<p>Plus, say you have a one-element list like ( 1 ), with both first and last pointing to that 1. Then say you want to insert another element from the front: you only have to change the element to which first points, and don't need to worry about last.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the iterator class within List, the starter file does not have any "public: " keyword, in which part you'd put the overloaded operators, constructor, etc. The comments say not to play with the public interface of List, but to clarify, we should be adding the "public: " keyword within Iterator for our implementations, yes? I don't see how else it could work.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Public Interface Within Iterator</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yup, you'll definitely need to add a public keyword to your Iterator implementation for the constructor, overloaded operators, etc. I think the comment about not modifying the public interface of List applies mainly to adding new public member functions/variables to the List class other than the possible ones specified (copy ctor, overloaded assignment operator, etc).</p></TEXT>

<p>I was passing the asserts in List_test00.cpp, but I kept getting a segmentation fault, and upon inspection, found that it was due to something in removeFront(). Before setting first to first-&gt;next, I was trying to set (first-&gt;next)-&gt;prev to 0, because it's going to become the new first element. After that, I assigned first = first-&gt;next, followed by deleting the "victim" node. Upon removing the line (first-&gt;next)-&gt;prev = 0, I had no seg fault. I guess I'm having a hard time understanding why this is causing a problem, because if I don't change this node's prev, the it is going to be pointing to deleted memory, the original "first" before calling removeFront(). Or could this just be an indirect consequence of something else wrong with my code?</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi, can somebody please clarify this, as I am stuck on a similar problem for removeFront() and removeBack()?</p>

<p>string streams are just another way of printing output (you simply put all the output in one string and at the end you print out the entire string)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok now I understand what the problem is. those string streams are not for printing output they are for getting the rational number in a way that is comparable to a string of what the rational number should be. Notice in the assert statement that the expected rational number is actually a string literal you wouldn't be able to compare a type rational number with a type string.</p>

<p>and you don't want to compare two rational numbers because you are testing the constructor to see if it's correct.</p>

<p>because you overrode the &lt;&lt; operator when you call s &lt;&lt; r it "prints" to that string stream and then we are using another function to convert that string stream into an actual string and comparing that string to what the rational number should be in string form.</p>

<p>don't worry about it not printing anything because it's not suppose to</p></TEXT>

<p>You're right that you need a template part - maybe you just had the syntax mixed up? In any case, try putting the "template" part at the very beginning and see if that clears things up. The first answer to this Stack Overflow question might give you some ideas:</p>

<p>The issue with the above^^ is that it does not necessarily take into account the fact that your class may be itself a template.  Check this link for more comprehensive answers:</p>

<p>It should output 0/0, not 0. Note that there is a difference between the two: one is the integer 0, the other is "undefined."</p></TEXT>

<p>The spec says -0 is the same as 0, so I think that should be negative infinity. You might want to double check with an instructor though!</p></TEXT>

<p>Are you running it on a CAEN machine, or somewhere different? If you're running it on a different system, it's possible that you have a different version of Python that may expect different syntax for .format.</p>
<p>Have you modified run_my_tests.py at all, including potentially by accident (e.g., opening it in a program that thinks it's being helpful by turning all your quotes to smart quotes)? Try downloading a clean copy of run_my_tests.py and see if that helps.</p>

<p>Hey Class,</p>

<p>I just was looking over the lecture cpp files for the template container lecture (the files are 19_list.cpp and 20_list.h). </p>

<p>I was looking at two functions, the insertFront and insertBack. In the header file, it is written as:</p>

<p>void List&lt;T&gt;::insertFront(const T &amp;v)</p>

<p>but in the .cpp file, it is written as: </p>

<p>void List&lt;T&gt;::insertFront(int i)</p>

<p>Can someone explain to me why theres a difference in the parameters between the two? An explanation would be greatly appreciated :) </p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
templated container lecture</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The .cpp is from the lecture before we introduced templated containers.  The .h is from the lecture in which we discussed templated containers.  The difference in parameters is because the .h allows for the List to hold any type of object not just integers.</p>
<p>If you are using those files as a means for finding coding help for project 5 I strongly recommend actually looking through the lectures and understanding why things in those files are the way they are.  I haven't looked at those files but I'd be careful that there aren't any bug inducing differences between those two files and what you need for project 5.</p></TEXT>

<p>I just realized that even though I took the Pre-Lab Survey and did the lab itself, I completely forgot to do the Post-Lab Survey.  It completely slipped my mind as there was no note about it on the assignment page itself (where you submit) or in the .pdf instructions for the lab.</p>

<p>I always double-check the Completion Criteria part of the lab (please see attached) as well as the table with the red highlighting in the lab .pdf to make sure I did all the appropriate work and since I did not see the post-lab survey, and since we had not had one in quite some time, I just had figured I was done.  (I had done the pre-lab survey on a separate day than I did the actual lab, which seemed to aid in my forgetting....)<br /><br />I see that the lab has not been graded yet.  Would it be at all possible for me to take the Post-Lab Survey still and have my lab count as credit?  I would really appreciate it.  If not, I understand, but I figured it would be worth asking.<br /><br />Thank you.</p>

Which element do we erase inside the iterator?  The spec doesn't say, but I assume the first element?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
erase(Iterator i)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Remember that an Iterator is sort of a "class pretending to be a pointer." Keeping that in mind, this function removes whatever element the Iterator currently points to. For example, if you have:</p>
<pre>List&lt;int&gt; list; // Put elements inside list
List&lt;int&gt;::Iterator i = list.begin();</pre>
<p>Then the Iterator i points to the beginning of the list, i.e. the first element in the list - so if you call list.erase(i), then the first element in the list should be erased. </p>

<p>Similarly, imagine you didn't call the erase function yet, but instead incremented i after initializing it to list.begin(). Then the Iterator would point to the second element of the list. Assuming the list has at least two elements, I can call list.erase(i) and expect that the second element will be removed from the list. </p>

<p>Hopefully that helps!</p></TEXT>

<p>once you call erase on an iterator is it invalidated(does point to what we want it to point to) and you should just make a new iterator</p>

<p>the issue is how the iterator is implements when you increment it, think about how the ++ operator works for iterator and what would happen if you tried to ++ and iterator that just erased a node?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry. I'm still not really getting your response.  I'm reading on my phone so maybe words are getting cut out on the margins.</p>
<p>Once we call erase on an Iterator should we assume all other existing Iterators for that List aren't valid and we should create a new Iterator if we need one rather than using any of the existing ones?</p>
<p>ie.</p>
<pre>List&lt;int&gt; example; //fill list
List::Iterator i = list.begin();
List::Iterator j = i; //at this point we have 2 iterators both of which
//have their node_ptr variable pointing to "first"
List::erase(i); //i's node_ptr variable should now point to Null
//the first node of example should have been deleted off of the heap
++j; //(or erase(j) or *j etc) should cause an error since j's node_ptr variable points to the now deleted Node     //from the example List and thus we can't access j-&gt;next for the increment</pre>
<p>What prevents this error from happening?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The pointer is now invalidated. As per the RME, it may also invalidate other Iterators. @2126</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok thanks. Just wanted to be sure.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes as soon as you call erase all iterators connected to that particular list are considered invalided </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What if you had the code above and then did:</p>
<p>List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator i1 = i;</p>
<p>Then if you call erase on i (thus erasing the first element in the list) and try to dereference i1 you get an already deleted error since i1 points to an invalid memory spot.  What would the fix for this be? Is that what the "may invalidate other list iterators" part of the RME is?</p></TEXT>

<p>In the calc.cpp part, I'm having trouble using the input. I initially thought to use a char as the variable, but because the input could be more than one digit if it was a number (10, 100, etc.), that won't work.

<p>whoops I am 0 for 2 now sorry about that try atoi then</p></TEXT>

<p>I did some research, and it seems stoi wasn't introduced until C++ 11, and I'm pretty sure g++ doesn't support it. I'm getting a compiler error that stoi wasn't declared.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If it's just one line where you convert a c++ string to a c-string (there is a standard function to do that too!!!) to call atoi that's fine because you are still reading things in as strings and for everything else dealing with c++ strings</p></TEXT>

<p>Using atoi requires converting the string that is an integer to a C-string. The spec says that using C++ strings instead of C-strings is a requirement. Is it still okay to use atoi?</p></TEXT>

<p>Do we need to make a default constructor for list since it is not given to us?</p></TEXT>

default constructor</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well, the comments for the starter header file say "You should add in a default constructor, destructor, copy constructor, and overloaded assignment operator, if appropriate," so the answer is not explicitly specified. However, keep in mind that the List class has some private member variables which you'll probably want to initialize upon creating a new object of the class. So...hopefully that gives you some ideas! Also, the supplement code from the lecture slides might be helpful!</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Stack's top() tests</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>There is no need to safeguard against it since it's part of the desired behavior (according the the RME). As far as testing it, you could use top() twice: once to change the value, and again to check the value.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>True, calc doesn't need it. It's mostly so you have a chance to see it and implement it (and test it). Also, think of it like this: the calculator uses the Stack module, specifically using <em>just</em> the aspects of Stack that it needs... this is actually a very common situation. You are working on some code and need to use a another tool/library/module to accomplish something. It is unlikely that you will use every single feature of that library in any given project. The library's job is to have the most useful features available, even if they are not all used simultaneously.</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>At any rate, the autograder will be testing top(). Cheers.</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, that makes sense, thank you! Now I also understand why we implemented erase() and insert() even though calc.cpp never uses them, either.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks for the response. However, having already completed calc.cpp, my implementation calls top() only once, when the user enters "p" and wants to print the top element of the stack without popping it. The reference to the top element (in this case, a Rational object) is then printed to standard output via the overloaded &lt;&lt; operator. Never does my calc.cpp modify the top value through top(), since the calculator isn't supposed to do that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please forgive me if this sounds a little rude, but what was the purpose of making top() return a reference? In calc.cpp, the reference is never used to change the value to which it refers. top() is also not called in any other file besides once in calc.cpp. I can only imagine preventing an unnecessary copy of a Rational object as reason to make top() return a reference, but I am not sure why allowing the user to modify the thing it refers to is a desired behaviour of top() since that never actually occurs in the project.</p></TEXT>

<p>Think about what either would entail.  If you make a private variable how would you update the size? Could you do it in the size function or would you have to keep track of all the functions that might change your member variable and adjust the variable accordingly within those functions?</p>
<p>What about the iterate idea?  Is it easier to implement and test?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the size function is a const member function. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>think about when the size changes, and then think about when you will actually need call the size function. is it worth it to have a private member variable to always have the current size or is it just easier to iterate through the list to find the size (which will take longer)</p></TEXT>

do you want to delete multiple things or just one thing? if you want to just delete one thing then why not just break out of the for loop after you call erase? if you want to delete multiple things then why not have two instances of iterators, were one iterates and the other will erase</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hi, I have question about the term "invalided" (which has been mentioned a lot by instructors answering all sort of question related to erase( ) ):</p>

<p>Since we are making the erase function pass by value, there is no way to really "invalidate" the iterator inside</p>
<p>the erase function. Even if I make the node_ptr of iterator points to null, it just invalidate the copy of the iterator, the node_ptr in the original iterator is still pointing to that piece of memory(the erased node) we just recycled.  </p>
<p>Wouldn't that be a issue? For the iterator is still sticking with a node "erased", rather than points to null? </p></TEXT>

Output operator issues for Stack.h</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For my output operator, I'm trying to use a for loop, but I keep getting an error and I'm not sure why. I thought I had the friend declaration correct, I declared it as such:</p>
<pre>  //Friend declaration
  template &lt;typename U&gt;
  friend std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;os, const Stack&lt;U&gt; &amp;obj);</pre>
<p>inside of the Stack class. </p>

<p>I then tried looping through to get every element, so I do</p>
<pre>template &lt;typename U&gt;
std::ostream &amp;operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream &amp;os, const Stack&lt;U&gt; &amp;obj) 
{
    for (typename List&lt;U&gt;::Iterator iter = typename Stack&lt;U&gt;::list.begin();
    iter != typename Stack&lt;U&gt;::list.end(); ++iter)
    {
      os &lt;&lt; *iter &lt;&lt; " ";
    }
  return os;

Output operator issues for Stack.h</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're over-using the typename keyword. Also, list.begin() doesn't need the "Stack&lt;U&gt;::" qualification. Same for list.end(). Those are the first things that jump out at me. There may be more issues after you fix those, but start with that.</p>

<p> Looking at this code from lecture:</p>
<p>   Iterator&amp; operator++(){</p>
<p>   node_ptr = node_ptr-&gt;next; </p>
<p>   return *this; </p>
<p>   }</p>

<p>why is *this being returned as opposed to the node_ptr being returned? How do we know that *this points to the updated node_ptr?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Postfix operator overloading question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you look at the function signature, "*this" doesn't ever point to a node_ptr, it's an Iterator.</p>

<p>The function updates the private member variable and returns itself so that it's able to be chained.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>template  List::List(const List &amp;l) : first(0), last(0) { copyAll(l); }</p>


<p>code above is from lecture slides…this is the copy constructors first line…why is first and last initialized to 0?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
copy constructor question?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>first and last are pointer variables. You need to initialize them to a safe value; it is basically setting them to NULL.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm confused about how to iterate through the current instance of the list for the size function…like there is no input in size so do we just use the variable this to traverse through the list? </p>
<p> In lecture professor used this code:</p>
<p>for (Node *np=l.begin(); np; np=np-&gt;next)<br /> insertBack(np-&gt;datum);<br />}</p>

<p>since i don't have a specific instance of the list, can i just use this.first for example and assign that to node np?</p></TEXT>

Does this mean I am writing to memory at an incorrect location?  Or  can it mean I am leaving a dangling pointer or not deleting something that is on the heap?

size and remove back</TEXT>

<p>It's possible that the error is actually in another function, but that it just manifests itself when you call this one. Try adding tests with all the different combinations of front/back insert plus front/back remove, and single elements vs multiple elements.

 <TEXT>
Erase() iterator i traversal confusion</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Fyi: You don't have post-increment (i++) available to you, only pre-increment (++i).</p>

<p>The increment operators make permanent changes to the variable.</p>
<p>Also, "first = i" won't work if first is a Node*.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Dereferencing the 'i' would give you something of type T (i.e. the type stored inside the Node). You might be thinking of "first = i.node_ptr".</p>

<p>Better question, what are you trying to accomplish with this code snippet?</p>

<p>For erase() you don't need to be doing any traversal. The iterator passed in points to the node you're erasing. Also, the iterator itself is invalidated after erase is called.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>how can i make (first == i) work? should i just dereference the i and do (first == *i)?  </p>

<p>To clarify: the pointer variable called "colo" is a stack variable. It is initialized to the address of a Gorilla object on the heap.</p>

<p>So i am trying to traverse through the list using an iterator to count the size. The only real issue I am encountering is how to use the begin and end because size does not accept a parameter.

<p>I'm trying to implement count_if, but I'm running into a few problems (well, one problem where each solution nets other problems) with template stuffs.  I'm trying to iterate through the stack's list and checking the value against the pred function.</p>

<p>The main problem is having two typenames, Predicate and T.</p>

<p>If I try to have template &lt;typename&gt; for both typenames, I get an error where there are too many typenames.</p>

<p>If I try to have template &lt;typename T&gt; inside the function, I get an error where I can't have a template inside the function.</p>

<p>If I try to have either Predicate or T as the declared template, then I get an error where the compiler doesn't know what the undeclared typename is.</p>

<p>Am I going about the count_if function wrong or is this just a template typename tragedy?</p></TEXT>

count_if template troubles</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I had a really hard problem getting count_if to compile as well, so try this! (I had to do some trial and error here because templates aren't my strongest skill just yet.)</p>

<p>Do you see how we have to put &lt;typename T&gt; in front of every function implementation because the class is templated? We have to do that here too. This template T needs to go before typename Predicate, however, and I'm not exactly sure why. It might be because pred is a template within a templated class. We must have to tell the compiler the order of templating or something (I tried it the other way and got compiler errors).</p>
<p>I used an Iterator in this function as well, and make sure you have another typename in front of your List&lt;T&gt; Iterator. See the last page of the spec for this info.</p></TEXT>

using iterator</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In main (or wherever you're using the iterator that isn't the iterator declaration in List.h) you need to use the actual type of the list that you're iterating through.  So if you have an int list, when declaring the iterator you need to use List&lt;int&gt;::Iterator.  Same for double or Gorilla, etc.  T is just a filler that makes the idea of an iterator into an abstraction.</p></TEXT>

You're trying to declare two loop variables in the same declaration, but the variables are of different types - they need to be the same for that to work. Pull one of them out (i.e. declare one of them outside the loop).

<p>I'm a bit confused about what insert is supposed to do. My understanding is that the parameters are an iterator (a pointer in the list) and a datum. Do we insert the datum at the place before the iterator pointer? So if we already have an integer list with 1 and 3 and i were to call insert with the pointer to the 3 and the datum 2, would insert then make the list 1, 2, 3?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Insert() in List class</TEXT>

<p>Yes that is correct. Insert the note with the datum before the node the iterator passed in is pointing to.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, that sounds good to me.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If it's an empty list, does that mean that the iterator passed is a null pointer and we would simply create a new node and modify the member variables "first" and "last"?</p></TEXT>

<pre>bool AnimalLess (const Animal &amp;a, const Animal &amp;b);</pre>

<p>Professor DeOrio mentioned something about "creating something on the fly". For the GreaterN funtion, it makes sense, because you want to be able to control the limit, but with AnimalLess, there are no private member variables that allow for greater flexibility.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
functor lecture AnimalLess</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>think of functors as C++ style function pointers. So what if the animal class had a bunch of different attributes like name, size, color, weight... now what if we wanted to generalize a sort function for animals that way we could have one sort function that sorted all the given animals based on whatever functor we passed in.</p>

<p>the in class example is a little iffy because we didn't give the animal class a whole bunch of attributes but it's just to show you the syntax and let you know how it works</p></TEXT>

<p>Try switching the templates around. I believe you need to tell the compiler that you want to use a template of typename T before you tell it that you are using a template of class Predicate.</p>

"Past the end"</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>We don't actually know what memory address comes directly after the node at the end. Plus, it's not really important what that address is. The point of using nodes is to connect each node to one another through the use of the 'next' and 'prev' pointers because these nodes are not actually necessarily next to each other in memory. Therefore, it is more convenient to just say that "past the end" is NULL so that we can tell that we are at the end of the linked list by just checking for a NULL address.</p></TEXT>

Only the class that has the private stuff that others are trying to access is allowed to give consent. You can't tell List, "Hey, function in list, you are allowed to use Iterator's private functions!" What you can do, however, is put the friend declaration into Iterator. Somewhere in Iterator (anywhere is fine), just tell Iterator that it is lets List touch its private parts. Specifically, you need to add the friend class declaration friend class List; inside of Iterator. This is like Iterator saying, "Hey List, you are my friend, so you are allowed to touch my private parts, and this includes being allowed to use my custom constuctor for the begin() function!"<br /><br />Now, Nodes remain hidden from the public (ie: custom constructor--which takes in a node_ptr-- is still private) AND List is happy because it is able to use the custom constructor for the begin function (Iterator told List, "It is ok to touch my privates" through the friend class List declaration! "Why I do declare! it is ok for you to touch me because you are my special friend :D") </p></TEXT>

<p>Shouldn't the default constructor set the node_ptr to "past the end" aka null, as stated in @2211? It sounds like this answer is describing the default constructor making an iterator for the first element.</p>

<p>Is it okay to declare the List begin and end functions as friends to the iterator class, so they can use the private constructor?</p></TEXT>

<p>Iterator does points to something on the heap (a list). Since a list is dynamic memory, only it is responsible for "cleaning up" after itself.</p>

<p>Also with your example you didn't use the word "new" so I'm not even sure that would work.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So does the Iterator need a copy constructor or overloaded assignment operator?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you need one of the big three, you must likely 99% need all when dealing with dynamic memory.</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>I'm having trouble figuring out how to write the syntax of the List's overloaded assignment operator.</p>

 <TEXT>
Syntax for scope resolution operator</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The first part of the code is trying to tell the compiler that there's a List defined inside List. I can see how you could arrive at that idea, but in this case we don't need to declare the scope for the return value. That being said, there is some funky stuff going on regarding templating: what <em>kind </em>of List are we returning? An <tt>int</tt> list? <tt>double</tt> list? Also, how does the function know that T is a templated type? I believe that this function is very similar to one created in the linked-list slides from lecture, so that may be a good resource to reference.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So we only need to access the List type, which is a public type that is defined when we say<tt> class List</tt>. The operator, however, is a function within the scope of that class, so we need to put ourselves in that scope to access the function, but not the List type.</p>

<p>The return type should be the second one, but don't forget that you may want to chain assignments, so you need to return a reference.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So if we want to access the Iterator type, which is within the scope of List, do we need to do  <tt>List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator</tt> ?</p>

<p>However, Iterator is a class, so is it also a public type defined when we say <tt>class Iterator</tt>?</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Correct and correct, but we defined our Iterator within the curly braces of our List class, which means that it's inside of the List class scope. We defined our List class in global scope, so no need to preface it with a scope operator.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Why don't we need to declare the scope for the return value of List though? </p>

<p>Should the return type be just a List or should it be List&lt;T&gt;?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Your error does indeed involve scope. A good question to ask is where is the iterator type defined, and what scope do we need to be in for iterator to be a valid type? Adding this element will also tell the compiler what kind of list the iterator can operator on (i.e. a iterator operating on an <tt>int</tt> list is different than an iterator operating on a <tt>double</tt> list).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It seems like it would make sense to add <tt>List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator</tt> for scope resolution. </p>

<p>However, when the code is changed to this:</p>
<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt;<br />List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator&amp; List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator::operator++ () </pre>

<p>the compiler still gives the same error message.</p></TEXT>

<p>I ran into the same problem, but when i included the "typename" my code also worked.  Could an instructor endorse that this is a valid solution?</p></TEXT>

<p>Given that this is a graded project, I don't think you're going to get an instructor endorsement for what is a "correct" answer. That being said, if it compiles and gives you the right answer then you can probably rest easy knowing that it's a valid solution.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Oh, my bad! I was thinking of insert front and back!</p>

<p>It says you need a "valid" Iterator, so an Iterator can point to NULL and still be valid, I believe. So my answer is still yes.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How can you insert into an empty list though? Don't you need an iterator that points to a node in the list?</p>

<p>And how can you have an iterator that points to a node in the list if there are none?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I only ask because I disagree with Alexandra's answer. I'm pretty sure that an iterator that points to NULL is invalid.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I second this. Whether or not an Iterator that points to NULL is valid or not really depends on what the instructors think is valid.</p>
<p>If it were valid, then I would like to ask how else can we make sure that it is valid?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Oh, wait, after rereading the specs on List.h for insert and delete, I realized that the valid Iterator part only applies to delete, which makes complete sense. </p>

<p>So, my best guess that an Iterator whose node_ptr points to NULL is considered "invalid". However for insert, it does not require a valid Iterator, thus we are able to insert into an empty List.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Nope, nope I reread it wrong... sigh. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So can we insert into an empty list or not?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I am going to ask DeOrio in office hours probably. I asked Vidal, and even he was not completely sure. He says he thinks that we should be able to insert into an empty list; however, I argue that if we can insert into an empty list, then shouldn't we also be able to erase from an empty list? The REQUIRES clause for insert and erase both require that the iterator is a valid iterator associated with this list. Therefore, any valid iterator for insert must also be valid for erase.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hm, interesting. I was just equating it to inserting into a list (which you can do if the list is empty), so I thought you should be able to insert with an Iterator as well.</p>

<p>"Valid" is I guess what our question is. (I guess it would be easy enough to fix in my current code if it turns out we can't insert into an empty list because the iterator would be invalid. In my test cases I tried inserting into an empty list with an iterator pointing to NULL and it worked.)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>However, can we definitely not erase from an empty list? </p>

<p>I was looking through the List_compile_check.cpp file. In there, there's an iterator <tt>itr</tt> pointing to null and the code then inserts the number 42 at the iterator.</p>

<p>After, even though <tt>itr</tt> still points to null, the code then erases at that iterator.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>List_compile_check.cpp is useless for checking. It's just to make sure everything compiles. You don't actually run the code.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I raised the question with Vidal and here's what we discussed:</p>
<p>An Iterator is valid if it points to NULL or a Node in the list. An invalid Iterator can be one that used to point to a Node but that Node was erased or something, for example. So you can insert into an empty list.</p>
<p>I agree with what you are saying about if that's true, then you should be able to erase from an empty list. But conceptually that does not make sense, so I don't <em>think</em> we should be able to erase using an Iterator on an empty list (pointing to NULL).</p>
<p>@2237 mentions an "invalid" Iterator</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't think it makes sense to erase from an empty list. Wouldn't nothing change in the empty list?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>An instructor's answer would be nice.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm just saying that if we define a valid iterator to be either pointing to a node in the list or pointing to NULL, then we must apply that definition in both the insert and erase functions. Since both functions require a "valid iterator," we must handle the NULL case when we use the erase function.</p></TEXT>

<p>I am confused, when do you actually use the list destructor and for what reason?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
list destructor</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Remember that destructors are sort of the "opposite" of constructors; they run when an object is destroyed for the purpose of releasing allocated resources. So when you create a new object of class List, you're allocating memory dynamically using the new keyword, right? The destructor runs when your List "dies" or goes out of scope (the function ends, you hit the closing brace, etc) for the purpose of releasing the memory that List had claimed previously. It's like cleaning up after yourself, basically. Hope that helps.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I am just a little confused about on how should erase behave. This is what I think it does but I am not quite sure.</p>

 <TEXT>
void erase(Iterator i)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What you're passing in erase isn't an index like an array, it's an iterator, which is basically a pointer to something in the list. If you call erase to a certain iterator (which will point to an element in the linked list), then you want to delete that element and basically adjust the list as necessary to keep it linked. I hope that helps.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I just wanted to double check what constitutes a valid iterator  for the insert function. If the iterator that is passed is null, does that mean it's an empty list that is being passed? Are valid iterators allowed to go past the end of the List?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
valid iterator question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If the iterator points to null, the iterator is equal to end(); that is, it points to the spot just after the end of the list. Your insert function needs to insert the datum right before the element at the specified position, so you should insert at the end of the list. It might be an empty list, or it might have hundreds of nodes in it already; you need to be able to handle either case.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>True. As per instructor response above, iterators with node ptrs = 0 means it is equal to end() and is independent of the number of elements passed to the list. It could mean the end of an empty list or the end of a list with several elements.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>just to confirm:</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; TRUE/FALSE: given any list, <strong>all iterators with node ptrs = 0 </strong>are valid iterators associated with that list.</p></TEXT>

<p>In the comments of Stack.h, it mentions that s.pop(s.push(item)) should return item. In Stack_test00.cpp, I initialize stack s, and then assert(s.pop(s.push(5)) == 5), but I keep getting an error that this was an "invalid use of void expression". When I do these steps separately (i.e. s.push(5), then assert(s.pop() == 5)), it works just fine. Has anybody else come across this? </p></TEXT>

<p>There are a couple things mentioned in the RMEs of Stack.h that wouldn't actually work if you tried them, like top(S.push(item)) and the example you mentioned. The ones I've found relate to Stack::push() having a void return type.</p>

<p>It's possible that the interface was changed from last year. It's also a bit tricky to express multiple lines in a comment so it may just be a space saving feature. It could be an unintentional mistake, since the somewhat analogous Stack::pop() function has a return type. I would follow the spirit as opposed to the "letter of the law" and perform the operations sequentially, since it seems pretty likely that's what was intended. We won't know for 100% sure until an instructor chimes in.</p></TEXT>

<p>When you erase from a list using an iterator, should the iterator be updated?</p>

 <TEXT>
Erasing from a List using an Iterator</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The iterator will be invalid once you delete because that instance of the iterator is now pointing to a place in memory that was just freed. So you can no longer perform any operations with that iterator. So you should either create a new iterator or break out of the loop after you have finished deleting whatever it was you were trying to delete. Hope that helps. :O</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>I'm not sure if this is completely correct, but in class we were told that the reason we can make iterator the way we are in this project is because each instance of an iterator will only point to element in a list once in its lifespan, so if you were using the decrementing operator that would mean you're trying to access something that you've already accessed before which would be breaking that rule. So I don't think its against the rules to make it, but I don't think you'd want to use it anywhere because of that rule. </p></TEXT>

<p>Yes; the spec says that the invariants must hold <em>after</em> the Rational object is constructed, and the parameters passed into the constructor can be any integers such that the constructor will always succeed. So it looks like it's on you to make sure any Rationals with negative denominators are appropriately manipulated to still hold the correct value, but with a denominator always &gt;= 0.</p></TEXT>

<p>In our implementation of copyall(), should we clear the list first and then copy the nodes from <tt>l</tt> to <tt>k</tt>? Or should we just copy all nodes of <tt>l</tt> to the end of <tt>k</tt> and keep all the previous nodes of <tt>k</tt>? The RME does not specify</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
copyAll() invariant</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The copyAll() function shouldn't have to empty the list. If you want to make an exact copy of a list (as in remove all existing data), whatever function that will be calling copyAll() should handle the prior clean up (maybe something like a removeAll() function)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My understanding is that the list constructor would automatically be called upon the creation of an instance of a class. Do we specifically need a Stack constructor? Also, with regards to the big 3, the stack class is not responsible for calling new/delete, so I'm a bit confused as to whether or not it is necessary to create a destructor, copy constructor, and overloaded assignment operator for Stack.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Stack class question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From the starter file, only include the functions of the Constructor + Big 3 that are needed for the code to run as directed. If you make a <span style="text-decoration:underline">valid</span> implementation that uses the C++ default constructor, then that's fine. As for the big 3, you should try to understand exactly what they are doing, for example, when I want to set Stack A equal to Stack B (A = B), what sort of operations are needed?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Because the private data member is a list, I understand that means the big3 for the stack implementations would require that the dynamic elements of list is deleted as needed. So would it be okay to use the public implementations of the big 3 in list for the ones that will be needed in Stack?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
In our list_test files, are we responsible for testing these two functions?  They are private members of the List Class.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
copyAll/removeALLfunctions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>They cannot be tested outside of the Class, that is correct, however, if you have public functions that call these functions, they can be tested through those. (i.e. Big 3)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe we need to make the print function a friend of the stack class. Don't we need to declare that in the private section though?</p>

<p>However it says "you must not make any changes to the private section" in the starter files, so should the friend declaration be somewhere else?</p>

<p>Also, how exactly do we declare a function to be a friend? I've only ever seen it done with other classes</p>

</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>how would we declare an iterator for the member variable list in stack? </p>

<p>Right now I'm stuck with "List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator i" but that isn't working.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Declaring an Iterator in stack</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My guess is that it's missing a "typename" somewhere. The appendix of the spec explains that there's some pretty complicated stuff regarding typenames that applies to this project that we haven't fully learned yet. I'm not sure how technically correct this is, but what I've found is that, when I'm using the templated Iterator outside of the List.h file, I usually need to preface it with typename. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>ahh duh! that worked.</p></TEXT>

<p>After fixing all my compiler errors in stack, I got a compile of errors like this </p>

<p>first question, can the iterator point to a NULL such that it's technically pointing past the end of the list? If so, would that mean an iterator pointing to a NULL does not necessarily mean it's pointing to an empty list, but it could be pointing to the end of the list?</p>

<p>Then in that case, for the insert function, do we have to account for when the iterator is pointing to the end of the list so that it can insert into the back of the list or do we not have to worry about that situation because we have insertBack? Also, same for inserting to the beginning of a list because we already have a insertFront.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
iterator insert function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>First Question: Yes, an iterator pointing to NULL doesn't mean that it is an empty list, only that you want to insert before that location</p>

<p>Second Question: How does this change where we want to insert the data? If the list is empty and we send it NULL, then the first Node it will find will be the end of the list so insert before that. If we want to insert as the last element of a list, we still send NULL and the code should be able to identify that we still mean the end of the list, so insert before that.</p></TEXT>

<p>yes you need a default constructor for the stack, you still need to call the default constructor of list in stack so everything is initialized correctly</p>

 <TEXT>
Operations on Infinity?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think you should be able to account for those cases. For example, 2 / infinity is the same as (2 / 1) / (1 / 0). According to the rules of arithmetic on rationals, (2 / 1) / (1 / 0) = (2 * 0) / (1 * 1) = (0 / 1). I think this makes sense mathematically, as the limit of (1 / n) as n approaches infinity is 0.</p>

<p>I'm trying to iterate through the list of animals. I'm using a for loop, and I have created an iterator i in the for loop (I'm sure I've done this correctly). But I'm having trouble accessing the Animal pointed to by the iterator.</p>

<p>I'm trying to do i-&gt;get_name() and i-&gt;talk(), but I'm getting the error "Member reference base type Animal* is not a structure or union". I'm completely stuck. Can anyone help?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
issue iterating through animal list</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You are trying to access the member functions "get_name()" and "talk()" for your Animal::Iterator, but these are not member functions of the Iterator class. </p>

<p>You want your code to be accessing the specific member functions of the Animal* objects pointed to by the Iterator's "node_ptr" member variable. Think about how you can access the specific Animal* pointed to by "node_ptr" and how you would call its member functions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>We use friend classes when we want one class to have access to the private members of another class. As the member functions "gen_name()" and "talk()" are both declared under the public interface, there seems to be no need to use a friend class (see Lecture 20 Slides 31-33 for more details on friend declarations).</p>

<p>Are you sure that you're correctly accessing the Animal* pointed to by your Iterator's "node_ptr"? The syntax for this can be a little tricky.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>here is my syntax, do you see the error?<img src="https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/hyrdt7uykox4mt/hq5yd7azafs6p3/i3aw20ncxy3z/Screen_Shot_20141204_at_8.42.23_PM.png" /></p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For starters, notice that the "get_name()" member function returns a string and does not do any output. Therefore, you will need to wrap your "get_name()" call in a cout statement to output the name.</p>

<p>However, I'm a bit unsure about the "talk()" function. I did not access Animal* values the way you did. I instead used a combination of dereferencing and the arrow operator (there are a few combinations that work).</p>

<p>I looked at the implementation for the overloaded "-&gt;" operator in List.h, and according to the RME it "returns the address of the data in the pointed-to node [and] the compiler then re-applies the '-&gt;' operator with the returned pointer." Based on that specification, I believe that what you have written for each function *should* correctly call the function. Given your error, it's clear that my understanding of the function is wrong.</p>

<p>I'm going to mark this as "Unresolved" so that we can hopefully get an Instructor's explanation.</p></TEXT>

<p>Besides the unnecessary use of this-&gt;, the line of code you provided looks fine. I'd suggest you bring it to office hours and have a GSI take a look if you're having issues.

 <TEXT>
<p>Are we supposed to create and use a Stack Iterator to implement top? I can't think of another way that would allow us to access the address of the top of the stack.

 <TEXT>

<p>So I get a bit confused between references and pointers, but I think all you have to do is return the iterator's datum, which is returned as a reference (<em>not</em> a pointer) by the function</p></TEXT>

<p>The RME is pretty confusing, it looks to me like you want to return a reference to the iterator's datum, not the node_ptr</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Right, I understand the postfix part. But that was my question about pressing [enter] and then waiting for another command unless we type 'q'. Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I also had a question about this because these values I think are separated by whitespace?</p>

<p>I'm picturing an actual calculator so if you so 2 + 2 [enter] it would give you 4 but then you could punch in -2 and it would give you 2. So it's always waiting for a new input to compute. This is what our calculator is doing too, right?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From the spec:</p>

<p>"The calculator program is invoked with no arguments, and starts out with an empty stack. It takes its <strong>input from the standard input stream</strong>, and writes its output to the standard output stream."</p>

<p>"To run your calculator interactively, you can use: % calc And then <strong>start typing</strong> the commands"</p>

<p>Cin will take whatever is fed to it from the system, meaning that it could either be a) a user typing something and pressing enter, or b) a redirected file, eg. ./calc &lt; testInput.txt. You don't have to worry about this; simply use cin to get the next operation to perform.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Given that I can't find any other posts asking this, I'm guessing I'm missing something in the spec, but are we supposed to submit a ton of different test files for List like we did for Player and stuff in Project 4, or will it be ok to just put them all in List_test00.cpp this time?</p></TEXT>

<p>Could someone explain the point of the end() function?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
end() function</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Any list should point to null when it reaches the end of the list. If you were to create an iterator that started at the beginning of the list and incremented towards the end, at some point it would be null and the end of the list would be reached. However, this would require the user to understand the implementation of the doubly-linked list in order to use. By creating the end() function, you can enable to user to iterate to the end of the list without having to understand the lists' implementation. </p></TEXT>

<p>We have a stack of numbers, right? And we can receive more numbers, a few arithmetic operators, and a few single-letter commands. First we need to figure out what the user entered; we need to parse the input. If it's a number, we simply push it onto the stack. If it's an operator, we have a variety of behavior to perform depending on which operator it was. Did we get a +? Let's pop two numbers off, add them, then push the result back on. How about a d? We simply pop off a number, create a copy, and push both back on.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: we have some command as input and need to perform certain behavior for each type of command. Perhaps an if statement or switch statement would be of use here. Overloading any sort of assignment operator is far more complicated than this needs to be.</p></TEXT>

First we need to figure out what the user entered; we need to parse the input. If it's a number, we simply push it onto the stack. If it's an operator, we have a variety of behavior to perform depending on which operator it was. Did we get a +? Let's pop two numbers off, add them, then push the result back on. How about a d? We simply pop off a number, create a copy, and push both back on.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: we have some command as input and need to perform certain behavior for each type of command. Perhaps an if statement or switch statement would be of use here.</p></TEXT>

<p>For the standard output of a rational number, if the denominator is positive, should we print it as such?</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>I think the issue is more with "making corrections" per the student answer. I may have misunderstood the spec and instructors, but I thought we weren't allowed to change Rational.h, which means we can't have any new member functions.</p>

<p>Since the function checking the invariant couldn't be a member of the Rational class in that case, how could it adjust the private member variables of a Rational object? Unless we implement setter methods, but that's also changing Rational.h</p></TEXT>

<p>I don't quite understand the point of the list_compile_check.cpp test function. From my understanding so far, the function:</p>
<p>1. creates a list</p>
<p>2. adds two datums</p>
<p>3. removes those two datums (list is now null/empty)</p>
<p>4. constructs an iterator that points to the beginning of the list (the iterator is consequently NULL)</p>
<p>5. attempts to insert a datum before the iterator (before NULL space)</p>
<p>6. erases the NULL pointer</p>
<p>7. attempts to ++ the NULL pointer</p>
<p>8. attempts to dereference a NULL pointer</p>

<p>In my opinion, this test case is either a really hard corner test case or just an improper test case. It's also a requirement for the overloaded ++ operator that the iterator is not NULL.</p>

<p>Is anyone else having these problems? my list.h works on a normal list test perfectly fine.</p></TEXT>

<p>the point of the entire file is in the name, it's called list_compile_check.cpp it's literally only there for checking if you have written everything you need to and to make sure that after you've written stuff it all compiles.

<p>I have included "return 0;" at the end of my main() and the program correctly exits with a 0 exit value when "q" is entered.</p>

<p>Is there something I am missing?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Note: when running calc_test01 and calc_test02 input in the terminal, I have to manually exit the program (Ctrl + C) because the .in files do not have a "q" command at the end. Could this be my problem?</p></TEXT>

Autograder: Exit with nonzero status</TEXT>

<p>In your while loop, you're probably using some sort of bool variable which changes when "q" is typed. I would reccommend using something similar to the following to initiate your loop:</p>

Overloading operator error in Rational.cpp</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When is operator+() called? When we're doing something like "rationalA + rationalB". In this case, the compiler will effectively make a call to rationalA.operator+(rationalB). Why the compiler is sad in your case is because you're overloading operator+() with two arguments whereas the function should only take one argument.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It depends on where you declare your overloaded operators. From the snippet of code you posted, it looks like you're trying to implement them <em>inside</em> <em>of</em> the class.<br /><br />Rational <strong>Rational::</strong>operator+(const Rational&amp;, const Rational&amp;)</p>

<p>In this case, we'd be calling a member function operator+() on LHS (it'll be the <em>this </em>pointer) with RHS as the single argument. HOWEVER: for this project, you are supposed to be declaring and defining your overloaded operators <em>outside</em> <em>of</em> the class. If you look at Rational.h, you'll see<br /><br />Rational operator+(const Rational &amp;lhs, const Rational &amp;rhs)</p>

<p>Notice how there is no scope resolution operator (Rational::) in this case, meaning that we're defining this function <em>outside of</em> the class. Thus we must take two arguments because we don't have a <em>this</em> pointer to operate on.</p>

<div>In short, your overloaded operators should *not* use the scope resolution operator and will *not* have a <em>this</em> to operate on. You need to change your function signature to match what is in Rational.h, i.e.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rational operator+(const Rational &amp;lhs, const Rational &amp;rhs) {</div>
<div>  // Your code here</div>
<div>}</div></TEXT>

<p>Since "past the end" refers to a null ptr in a list, is there any way to distinguish an iterator at the end of a specific list?</p>

<p>List&lt;int&gt; other_list;</p>

<p>//fill lists...</p>

<p>List&lt;int&gt;::Iterator i = my_list.end();</p>
<p>other_list.insert(i, 12);</p>

<p>what's there to prevent you from using an iterator which points to the end of a specific list (in this case, my_list) to refer to the end in another list (other_list), since interator i = null?</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>There isn't any way to distinguish between two "end" (i.e. invalid, past the end) iterators for our List class, even if they are for different lists. It's interesting to think about, but it's sort of a coincidental thing having to do with the way iterators happen to internally represent their position in the List. It's almost certainly a bad idea to use them interchangeably, and the same isn't necessarily possible for iterators in general (e.g. an iterator into a container like a vector might store elements in an array and then the end iterator would have a pointer literally pointing past the end of the array - these wouldn't be the same for different ends of different vectors).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're right, it doesn't make semantic sense. It happens to work, but you shouldn't do it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>i'm not talking about loops, I'm referring to just using iterators like pointers to nodes. If an iterator points to "pass the end" of my_list, there's no way to distinguish it from referring to "pass the end" of other_list.</p>

<p>If i wanted to insert at the end of the other_list like my example above, i can use the iterator of my_list which refers to "pass the end" of my_list. Semantically it doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>It may not even be necessary for completion of the project, I'm just pointing it out.</p></TEXT>

<p>It seems like you won't actually need to do much to account for it. There's no such value of an integer as "-0", so if you read your numbers into an int, you can be guaranteed it's not "-0".

<p>The atoi function takes a string and converts it to an integer, so you should be able to use it for values with more than one digit. Also, I'm not sure how others approached the input part of calc.cpp, but I just set up my program to read in strings. A string can be a single character - i.e. "p" is a string of a length 1. Then, you can just check if the string read in matches a given calculator command, and if not it must be an integer.</p>

<p>Hopefully that helps.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Avoid using getline, it can cause some really odd behavior. However, as student answer said, reading information in one string at a time is typically a favorable approach.</p></TEXT>

<p>Since my list is empty when you call my list.begin, you return an iterator pointing to first and first is pointing to null, so iterator is pointing to null, then when you call my list.insert, you're able to insert a 42, but iter is still pointing to null, so the erase function will not execute properly. Any advice? Or does anybody see a mistake that we might be making? Thanks!</p></TEXT>

<p>Right now I'm trying to run unit tests on erase(i). My function works for the first element that I want to erase, but when I reset the iterator and try to erase another element, there is a segfault in the prefix operator at the line ptr = ptr-&gt;next. I'm pretty sure this is happening because of a null pointer, but I'm having trouble figuring out to how to fix it. Any suggestions?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
testing erase(i)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's fairly likely the root cause of the problem is a small error in one of your insertFront, insertBack, removeFront, or removeBack functions. One thing that proves fairly helpful is to draw a picture of the structure of the list and how it changes as your code runs through the test. You can also write a check_invariants() function for List that will catch almost all bugs of this kind immediately after they happen. Unfortunately, both of those things are difficult to walk through over Piazza, but any of us would be glad to help in more detail during office hours.</p></TEXT>

<p>One of the lecture slides describes a common pitfall: calling the base class constructor inside the derived class constructor, but outside the initializer list.  The example that went along with this is</p>

<p>class Isosceles : public Triangle {<br />//...<br />Isosceles(double base, double leg) {<br />Triangle(base, leg, leg);//bad<br />}<br />};</p>

<p>Can someone further explain what is wrong in this example.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Constructors Common Pitfall</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When you do this the code interprets this as your constructor is making a Triangle but doing nothing with it. Recall what</p>
<p>"Triangle(base, leg, leg);" would do anywhere else, it makes a new Triangle object, doesn't store it in anything, so gets destructed.</p>

Questions about erase</TEXT>

<p>Side note from another student's perspective: std::stoi() is implemented using the nothrow strtol()--it uses the second [out] parameter to detect failure. You can do just the same if you wish.

Infinity in Rational</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Going by the arithmetic laws enumerated in the spec: (a / b) + (c / d) = (ad + bc) / bd, so (1 / 0) + (1 / 0) = (1*0 + 0*1) / (0*0) = 0 / 0 = undefined. Then, for example, infinity + 2 = (1 / 0) + (2 / 1) = (1*1 + 0*2) / (0*1) = 1 / 0 = infinity.</p>

<p>The spec says "assume that the above formulas also work when infinities and undefined values are encountered," so I think it's safe to just go by the rules listed there.</p></TEXT>

<p>I think so. That's what the spec seems to suggest with the examples it gives too. Maybe best to ask an instructor though</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
understanding stack</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think the instructor response in @2143 might answer some of your questions. Yes, the stack just holds a list, and yes you're going to use List methods to work with Stack's list data member. I think a Stack is sort of like a specific type of a list, where you can do limited operations (i.e. pop and push one element at a time, etc) on a list and generally interact with that list in a specific way. This is useful because in the calculator program, we only really need to do a few things with a list, and that's how our Stack of Rationals "wraps up" the functionality of a List. (That's just my understanding though.)</p>

<p>I hope that helps!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I know a lot of questions are being asked about what happens to the iterator after erase runs and I wanted to clarify something. As I understand it, after erase runs the iterator becomes invalid. Does this mean that iterator is now garbage and has to be set to something else?</p>

<p>For example, you can't do iterator.erase() and then ++iterator or *iterator or do anything else with it before saying iterator = list.begin() again?</p>

<p>This seems to be the way it should work because, at least for me, the ++, *, and other operators/functions all require things like node_ptr-&gt;next or node_ptr-&gt;datum and these are not possible once erase runs and sets node_ptr to null.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
One more erase quesition</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yup, you're right. Once the Node to which an Iterator points is deleted, that Iterator is invalidated ("garbage", like you said) and should be set to NULL so as to avoid dangling pointers. If you incremented the iterator or tried to dereference it after a call to erase(), you'd probably get undefined behavior (that is, if you didn't already catch the error in an assert or something). In any case, those operations aren't legal once that Iterator no longer points to an existing Node, unless you set that Iterator to point to a valid Node afterwards.</p></TEXT>

<p>I wrote a static function to check invariants and I created a Rational object in the beginning of my implementation to use get_numerator() and get_denominator() but since creating a class object means calling a default constructor, numerator is always 0 and denominator is 1.

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Invariant</TEXT>

<p>I'm not exactly sure what your question is, but if you don't want to use the default constructor you just need to specify the arguments you want to use for some other constructor in an initializer in the declaration.</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>I believe that there is -0 and 0 so you need to recognize the -0 and change it to 0</p></TEXT>

<p>Well, your end goal is you want the elements in the destination list to be in the same order as the elements of the list you're copying. So depending on your implementation and which way you traverse the List (first-to-last or last-to-first) you could actually use either insertFront or insertBack; just keep in mind that if you traverse first-to-last, then calling insertFront will result in the first element of the old list being the last element of the new, and so on...if that makes sense!</p></TEXT>

<p>I have the same question... will it be incorrect if we have an extra space before the newline after the last element in the stack's list is printed out?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The print all function specification from the spec says:</p>
<p>"print all items on the stack in one line, from top-most to bottom-most, <strong>each value</strong> followed by a single space. The end of the output must be followed by exactly one newline."</p>

<p>To my understanding, each element (including the final element) will be followed by a space. The final space will then be followed by a newline.</p>

<p>If our Stack contained {1,2,3,4} (from top to bottom), our output would therefore be:</p>
<p>1[space]2[space]3[space]4[space]&lt;NEWLINE&gt;</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How can we use the overloaded "&lt;&lt;" operator, though?  The overloaded operator EFFECTS clause says to print a single space after the first element.  The print-all function says to print a new line directly after the last element</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would consider what you want a stack to output when you use operator&lt;&lt;, and then whether or not you need to use any sort of iteration for the 'a' command. This may force you to change your implementation of the 'p' command.</p></TEXT>

<p>get_numerator is a const function but in the RME for it it asks "</p>
<p>Returns denominator that is consistent with the invariants.</p>
<p>    after eliminating any common factors. See invariants."</p>
<p>How are we to eliminate the common factor when we aren't allowed to change the values because the function is const?</p>

<p>Even within checking the invariants and when we do alter the values, how are we to access the private member variables, denominator and numerator? is it okay to set the rational number equal to a newly constructed rational number like</p>
<p>Say Rational r has numerator = 2 and denominator = 4</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>r = Rational(1, 2);</p>
<p>okay to do to alter that number?</p>
<p>(obviously we wouldn't brute force every possibility, this is just for example)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Invariant - altering the values</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I might be misunderstanding your question, but if you're asking how to make sure the rational number is in its lowest terms, you'll want to handle that in the constructor for rational. A self referential constructor sounds like a pretty poor idea to me.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
so maybe you want to check invariants and gcd in the functions where you could change the actual numbers instead of in your getters which are const</TEXT>

overloaded operators for Iterator</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The overload operators for iterator should only be called on valid iterators, so yes.</p>

<p>Asserts will help you debug when you are writing your program, but I would suggest removing them when you submit your project. If a user of your iterator class calls any kind of function that requires a valid iterator with an invalid iterator, that behavior is "unpredictable" so you do not need to account for a user misusing your class/functions.</p></TEXT>

This is how postfix works.<br />    }</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
can somebody explain the following two functions? when should we return the reference?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the prefix overload (++it):</p>
<p>You are incrementing the node_ptr to point to the next thing. You are returning yourself, the iterator, so you can do things like ++++it and it will successfully increment the iterator twice. Also, when you output the iterator:</p>
<p>cout &lt;&lt; ++it &lt;&lt; endl;</p>
<p>You're going to output the value of the iterator after it was incremented.</p>

<p>In the postfix overload (it++):</p>
<p>You are creating a copy of the iterator and returning that because postfix wont be completed until after the new line. What that means is if you do:</p>
<p>cout &lt;&lt; it++ &lt;&lt; endl;</p>
<p>You're going to output the value before it was incremented because it hasn't "technically" been "incremented" yet. By returning the copy instead of the actual iterator, you are maintaining the illusion that the iterator has not been incremented until after the new line.</p>

<p>Does that make sense/help?</p></TEXT>

<p>How are we supposed to create helper functions to simplify rationals and check invariants if we cannot access the private member variables denominator and numerator? The specs say not to alter Rational.h so we can't declare these functions as member functions of the Rational class.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Helper functions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Since you are not allowed to alter Rational.h in any way, I would say it is not possible to create helper functions in the implementation of Rational. You may, however, use functions you've implemented in the Rational.h class to help you implement other functions in Rational.h -- similar to Project 4 how you could've called "reset()" in the constructor of the deck instead of just copying and pasting code from the constructor to reset or vice versa.</p></TEXT>

<p>I want to use a functor with my count_if function, and my question is should we declare this outside of main in our calc.cpp file?</p>

Functor input for count_if - where to implement</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It looks like prior to c++11, you can declare a class like a functor inside a function, but not if it uses templates. I tested it out and got an error</p>
<pre>Severity	Description	Project	File	Line
Error	error C2951: template declarations are only permitted at global, namespace, or class scope	Project1	test.cpp	10
</pre>

<p>One way to "hide" a functor would be to declare it in a nameless namespace. That allows it to be used in the file where the namespace is declared but not anywhere else. To give an example that isn't related to the project:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;<br />#include &lt;cassert&gt;<br /><br />namespace<br />{<br />	template &lt;typename T&gt;<br />	class Adder<br />	{<br />	public:<br />		Adder(T stuff)<br />		{<br />			my_stuff = stuff;<br />		}<br />		T operator() (T stuff)<br />		{<br />			return stuff + my_stuff;<br />		}<br />	private:<br />		T my_stuff;<br />	};<br />}<br />int main()<br />{<br />	Adder&lt;int&gt; add40 = Adder&lt;int&gt;(40);<br />	assert(add40(2) == 42);<br /><br />	return 0;<br />}</pre>
</TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Syntax with node_ptr</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ahh so, when you declare:</p>

<p>Node* hold1, hold2; </p>

<p>what's happening hold1 is of type Node* and hold2 is of type Node. When you declare 2 pointers, the pointer "belongs" to the variable because that is the thing that is differentiating it from just being a normal Node and a Node*. If you would like to declare two node pointers on the same line you will have to do:</p>

<p>Node* hold1, *hold2; </p>
<p>or Node *hold1, *hold2; //I personally think this is more clear</p>

<p>This will say, "I am declaring two node pointers"</p></TEXT>

<p>There is an bug somewhere in my Rational function causing tests00 to never finish running (after compiling). But I am having trouble locating it because an assertion is not failed, and nothing is bring printed with cout.</p>

<p>I tried writing "cout &lt;&lt; 1;" as the first line in main in Rational_test00.cpp, but nothing is printed.</p>

<p>It still fails an assert(0) placed at the start of main(), so it is running.</p>

<p>Did i possibly do something incorrect with my &lt;&lt; overload to make it no longer function properly with anything else?</p>

<p>Edit: i googled the problem, and i needed to add a &lt;&lt; endl; to flush the stream for some reason. didn't think i'd need it for one output</p></TEXT>

<p>In the lecture, we have</p>
<p>List&lt;Gorilla*&gt; zoo;</p>
<p>zoo.insertFront(new Gorilla);</p>
<p>How can we do this?</p>
<p>From my personal view, it should be new &amp;Gorilla because you need to pass a pointer to the object to the function rather than the object itself.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
insertFront()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When you call:</p>

<p>new Gorilla</p>

<p>what happens is the object Gorilla is created somewhere on the heap and the memory address of its location is returned to you. That's why when you call "new" anything, like an int, the variable that stores the value is a pointer (e.i. int *i = new int;). By passing in "new Gorilla" you are passing in the memory address of where Gorilla is located, which is exactly what you are doing when you're passing in a pointer to Gorilla. </p></TEXT>

Why donot we need to overload = operator in iterator?</TEXT>

<p>I'm testing my destructor on a list of pointers to dynamic ints, and when I run the erase() function on this list I'm realizing that erase() only deletes the node and the pointer, not the int that it actually points to. For example: </p>

<pre>List&lt;int*&gt; pointer_list;
pointer_list.insertBack(new int);<br />pointer_list.insertBack(new int);<br />pointer_list.insertBack(new int);
pointer_list.~List();</pre>
<p>Now valgrind says I have 3 blocks of leaked memory. I understand that I should need to delete these pointers in the erase() function but there's no way to tell if it's a pointer, and if you try to delete something that isn't a pointer the compiler throws errors.</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Using erase() on a list of pointers</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This is because the datum in the list is also dynamically allocated. When you erase something in the list, you only delete the node. I do not believe we expect your list to be able to delete the datum if it has been dynamically allocated, so you do not need to worry about that.</p>

<p>Instead, when testing your list for memory leaks I would just place ints, doubles, strings, chars, etc. into a list and then delete the linked list and see if there are any memory leaks. If there are, that means the method you are using to delete nodes in your list is incorrect.</p></TEXT>

<p>when we overload postfix and prefix operator? How do we know it is prefix and postfix since they both use notation ++</p></TEXT>

postfix and prefix</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you check out the supplement code from lecture 20 (List.h), you'll see two versions of an overloaded ++ with comments saying which one is prefix and which one is postfix. Basically, prefix ++ returns a reference and takes no arguments, whereas postfix returns a copy, rather than a reference, and takes a "dummy" int as a parameter. </p></TEXT>

<p>it makes it so that when you can deref an iterator with i-&gt;node_ptr rather than (*i).node_ptr.  It's the same use of -&gt; that you're used to.  We're just redefining it to also work for iterators.</p></TEXT>

&amp; meaning?</TEXT>

<p>You just have to look at the context. If it is attached to a type (for example, T &amp;), it is a reference. If it is attached to a variable name (for example, &amp;number), it is an address.</p></TEXT>

<p>@2281 might help clarify a bit if you're confused about what exactly references are.</p>

<p>I'm not sure there's an easy way to explain the difference, or that this is any more in depth (I'm really just reiterating Brian's points), but typically if there's an ampersand in a declaration, it's a reference. On the other hand when the ampersand is used as an operator, it returns the address of something.</p></TEXT>

I'm having a hard time figuring out the syntax for the Stack default constructor. I tried using an initializer list and calling the List default constructor but I'm getting an error. I also tried it without an initializer list and called:
list.List()
inside of Stack(), but that's giving me errors as well. Any idea how I can fix this?</TEXT>

<p>Take a look at your destructor. You're probably doing something like:</p>

<p>There is one post regarding this but wasn't helpful to me. I am getting a segfault error on my insertFront function and I can't figure out why. I've checked to see if the list is empty and, if so, set the first and last node equal to the new node. I then wrote the rest of the code regarding the scenario where the list is not empty, and cannot figure out why the segfault is happening. Any ideas?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
insertFront segfault</TEXT>

<p>Your best bet would be to watch some of the variables in GDB. It seems like you could be trying to access a null pointer, and without seeing your code it would be pretty hard to guess how you implemented the function. What seems most likely (although you already accounted for this) is that you're somehow trying to dereference first or last when they don't exist.</p></TEXT>

I'm confused about whether or not we need a stack constructor. I assumed that since stack only holds a List, which already constructs itself, we do not need a constructor. However, there is a Piazza post saying we need a constructor and another saying we don't.

Any help is much appreciated!</TEXT>

So I did this and it says "conditional jump or move depends on uninitialized variables" and lists many functions that are called in List.h, Stack.h, and Stack_test00.cpp. 
1) does this mean List.h could have a problem even if its valgrind clean?

<p>This is super late and chances are it's already been solved but just for completion's sake:</p>

<p>1) yes, using an uninitialized variable for an if statement (or something of the like) is a pretty hard to catch error, it might break your program or it might not.</p>

<p>2) The 2nd part of your for loop is a conditional, are you comparing something to an uninitialized variable? Like one that isn't the one you just declared in the 1st part of the loop?</p></TEXT>

<p>In testing my code on the Linux command line, giving the input "3" puts the rational 3/1 into the stack and giving the input "200" puts the rational 200/1 on the stack, but giving the input "200 3" places the rationals 200/1 and 300/1 on the stack in the correct order.</p>

<p>Inputs are grabbed from the command line via getline(cin, string) and are pulled apart in a smaller loop via strings. The string used to store each command is local to the loop and gets remade on each iteration, and the integer variable used to call the rational constructor is reset as well.</p>

<p>Using string.length() to obtain the size of the string shows "200" has a length of 3 and "3" has a length of 1, even though 300 still gets pushed onto the stack.</p>

<p>node_ptr = node_ptr-&gt;next;</p>

<p>Is this how the ++i operator is supposed to work?  If so, how do we account for that in the for loop? If not, how do we go about fixing it?  In our List test cases, we tested all theiterator operations and they passed.</p></TEXT>

It depends on how your while loop is structured. What should happen is after executing your last command (whatever it may be) your program should just "wait" until it receives another command. Check your while loop and make sure you're not executing the previous command over and over again if you don't receive anything.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No, don't break out of the while loop. Only do that when q is called. You may post your code privately, but we wont tell you how to implement anything -- that is up to your discretion.</p></TEXT>

<p>are you storing the last command in a variable declared outside the scope of the loop? If so, maybe it's possible the last command is not getting overwritten?

<p>We are really confused with the match operator. If the count_if function is going through each item in the list, how do we use it to compare the popped item to each item the iterator is pointing to?</p>

<p>I understand how is_even is used with count_if, but that is only taking into account the item that the iterator is pointing to. But should we use a comparison functor, but the predicate only takes in one input in count_if?</p>

Help with match operator</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The way count if will be used in this project makes it so that its almost a must to use a functor. What we did was create a functor that was very flexible, we could initialize it with a fixed number that would be compared to any number it received via the '( )' operator.  We were able to change the number it was being compared to via a loop. </p>

<p>The lecture slides on functors should be very helpful for this. Hope that helps!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can do it in the .cpp file where you define your functor like so:</p>

<pre>class MyFunctor
{
    bool operator() (typename variable)
        {
             //override it here.
        }
};</pre>

<p>In terminal you can do:</p>

<p>to redirect input to come from the file calc_test01.in, and to store the output in a file called calc_test01.out. Then, if you want to diff it against the given .out.correct file, do:</p>
<pre>diff calc_test01.out calc_test01.out.correct</pre>

<p>Are we testing cases when the variable type is char instead of int?</p>
<p>I know that we won't be using chars later on but since List class is template should we consider this as one of the test cases?</p>
<p>Also, what are some of the boundary cases to test List class?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
List_test</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That's definitely a valid thing to test - your List class is templated, meaning it should work with different types, not just ints. And as for boundary test cases, I don't think we're allowed to share specific test cases. That said, just think about what you'd consider "normal" lists, and then whatever doesn't fall under that category could be considered "weird" lists - lists that might only be created or used in very specific cases, or lists that contain unexpected elements, or things like that. Hopefully that gives you a few ideas!</p></TEXT>

<p>I implemented the overloaded != operator for List. However, there is no such operator defined for the Rational class. Since the Rational class is used inside the Stack class throughout calc.cpp, there is a compilation error. The message goes as follows:</p>

<p>It looks like you're checking to see whether a Node's datum is not equal to another Node's datum. I can't think of anywhere that you actually need to do that. Have a look at 20_List.h in CTools &gt; Resources &gt; Lectures for an example of a different way to implement !=.</p></TEXT>

<p>this, may invalidate other list iterators</p>
<p>I am confused with this statement in RME.</p>
<p>Basically, what does erase() do?</p>
<p>insert()?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
erase()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>An invalidated iterator in the context of a List is an iterator that points to a Node that no longer exists. If you have an Iterator i and you call erase(i), then i will be invalidated because the Node that i points to no longer exists. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You have to reassign the Iterator to a valid Node. Something like "i = list.begin()". </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Can I set ++i to validate i?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
That will not validate i (assuming you already called erase(i)) because the Iterator is already invalidated. Once the Iterator is invalidated you can no longer access the old Node, and so you can't access the next pointer, and so you can't call ++i. And when I say can't, I mean that the results are undefined.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You dont need to validate again, right? Because in the RME it states that the function invalidates other list iterators?<br /><br />But is it supposed to invalidate the iterator that is passed in as a parameter? or just other list iterators?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok. From my understanding, it is only required us to validate i but it doesn't matter where we set i ? Is that correct?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For anonymous: I have exactly the same question. The RME is quite ambiguous.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
In the erase function you do not have to do anything to the invalidated Iterator. The invalidation problem is for the user (ie. main) to worry about.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How to validate i again?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>We are having trouble getting our overloaded ++ operator for Iterator to compile. The trouble seems to be due to the fact that we are returning a reference to an Iterator, and the compiler won't recognize the Iterator as a type, which might mean our scoping syntax is off. The compiler is flagging the name of our function with this error:</p>

<p>expected constructor, destructor, or type conversion before ‘&amp;’ token<br /><br /></p>
<p>Our definition is structured as follows:</p>

<p>Iterator&amp; List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator::operator++ () //compiler flags this line with an error</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>   //Implementation</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>Any thoughts/help would be appreciated. We could circumvent the problem by defining the operator inside Iterator, but we've already done the other ones outside of it.</p></TEXT>

<p>I am  a LSA student taking EECS280. I can't use my Visual studio because the licence expired. Some of my friends also have the same situation. </p>
<p>Since the final is approaching, visual studio become more important to us because we can write a few lines of code and test our understanding whenever we want!   I try to email eecs280 staff, but I haven't got any reply...</p>

<p>Is there are anyway that someone can help us upgrade our software?   </p></TEXT>

<p>hm, I just realized LSA students don't have access to all the free software engineering students have access to. You can still get some free software just with a .edu address though on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dreamspark.com/Student/Software-Catalog.aspx">microsoft dreamspark</a> site. Visual Studio 2013 is on there, it might be worth it to try reinstalling with a new installer/ISO to renew whatever sort of license is built in.<br /><br /></p></TEXT>

Why donot we have default constructor for Stack.h?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Because the Stack is derived from List, the default Stack constructor calls the default List constructor, which creates an empty list. Therefore you don't really need to.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Are we not allowed to initialize list(0)?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Does Stack.h have a member function that calls new?  Or does it use List's member functions to call new?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Stack uses List. List handles it's own memory management.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>When implementing the list member functions, why is it allowed to just do first = node instead of having to do this-&gt;first = node?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
List member functions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You don't need to say "this" when you are implementing any of the member functions because when implementing the member functions, it's already implied that you are editing "this" (yourself) and you are allowed to use any of your member variables or functions when doing that.</p></TEXT>

<div>When me and my partner submitted to the autograder, some of our List_tests had compilation failures, yet can't find a consistent source of what would be causing it. They all compile on Linux with the Makefile commands make my-tests and make all correctly. We included iostream, List.h, and cassert at the top. We asked a GSI in office hours this morning, and after a good 45 minutes she could not think of why this would be happening. Does any one else in the staff know why?

So are we going to be responsible for testing all possible data types that List can hold?  If we test a list, we have to create an instance of the list and make it a specific type.

<p>so if we make an iterator that points to the end of the list, that iterator is going to be null but can't a null iterator also point to the beginning of an empty list? i keep trying to account for this in my insert() function but i keep getting a segfault</p></TEXT>

question about insert()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Insert is only allowed to be called on valid iterators. An iterator that points to NULL is not a valid iterator.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I've been told from other instructors in office hours that NULL is a valid Iterator, so if we call insert with an Iterator that is NULL, we should create a list with 1 element.</p>

<p>Can an instructor confirm which is correct: NULL is an invalid Iterator and we cannot call insert with NULL, or NULL is a valid Iterator and we can call insert with NULL?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hello, Anons. Iterators that point to null are valid iterators for the insert function. You're allowed to point to the end of a list and insert right before it and that list can either be empty or full of datums and the insert function doesn't care. Here is another instructor response on it that might clarify the issue- @2226 . I hope that helps.</p></TEXT>

<p>Should we just assume that infinity + infinity = infinity and -inifinity - infinity = -infinity?</p>

<p>The spec seems to suggest that we should not need to make special cases when we overload operators such as + (ie: 1/0 + 1/0 = (1*0 + 1 * 0)/ (0*0) = 0/0  ) but mathematically, this doesn't make sense for operations like infinity + infinity.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
operations on infinity</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>After the arithmetic laws for rational numbers are listed, the spec says "assume that the above formulas will also work when infinities and undefined values are encountered." So I think the idea is that you don't need to do extra checking for cases like the ones you described, even though mathematically they might not make sense. All the examples given for the undefined/infinity cases work out because of the arithmetic laws given as well, so I assume they extend to all other special cases.</p>

<p>But it would be nice to have an instructor clarify this...</p></TEXT>

<p>I agree it can be frustrating to not know why certain test cases are failing and so on, but I think part of the issue is that the more the projects are dissected and explored, the less useful they are as a test of how well you can write code.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't see how dissecting and exploring the projects after they have been used to test your ability to code makes them less valid as tests.</p>

<p>A main goal of this class should be to help improve your coding skills, and I feel that by not being provided more feedback on projects, we are being deprived of an important and useful resource for improvement - learning from mistakes. The projects should be used not just as a test of our coding ability and grasp of concepts, but they should be used as a learning tool as well.</p></TEXT>

<p>I am also facing this issue. I did end with exit(0) if 'q' is typed in. But the auto grader just says  "exits with non-zero status"</p>

<p>Besides, if i use </p>
<p>./calc &lt; calc.test01.in</p>
<p>the program just first give the correct answer, then give a huge amount of 4 (the last correct answer).</p>

<p>and if i add a 'q' in the end of the .in file every thing goes correctly.</p></TEXT>

Are you still having this issue? If so, stop by my office hours and I'll look at your code. Alternatively, you can make a new Private post and include that portion of your code.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Just to clarify: I am not using exit(1) or exit(0) or anything. When a q is entered, we leave a while loop which results in a return 0 being reached. Also when everything from the file has been read in and all the appropriate responses have been given (i.e. the diff file returns nothing) the program is still in an infinite loop and any keyboard input doesn't work, so we have to control c to exit the program. Running without the infile the program works perfectly fine. </p></TEXT>

<p>for(List&lt;int&gt;::Iterator i = r.begin(); i != r.end(); ++i) {<br />        r.erase(i); // should erase every member in the list<br /> }<br /> assert(r.size() == 0);</p>

<p>where r is the name of the List and there is already another loop before this one to insert values. The loop succeeds in normal testing.</p>

<p>But when I run this in valgrind, I receive an error message like this: "Invalid read of size 8"</p>

<p>Thus, when I ran this:</p>
<p>List&lt;int&gt;::Iterator i = r.begin();</p>
<p>r.erase(i);</p>

<p>The error message disappeared.</p>

<p>My question is, is it correct in using erase(i) in a loop like this? Or is the error in the erase() function?</p>

<p>Below is my erase() code:</p>

<p>void erase(Iterator i) {pluck_node(i.current-&gt;prev, i.current-&gt;next);}</p>

<p>TEMPLATED T LIST_METHOD pluck_node(Node* lhs, Node* rhs) {<br />      Node* np = (lhs!=NULL ? lhs-&gt;next : rhs!=NULL ? rhs-&gt;prev : first); // find node to pluck,<br />      link_nodes(lhs, rhs); // being careful in case<br />      if(first==np) {first=rhs;} // of length==1.<br />      if(last==np) {last=lhs;}<br />      T result = np-&gt;datum;<br />      delete np; length -= 1;<br />      return result;<br />}</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Using Erase() everything in a Loop</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You can't use erase in a loop like this because erase invalidates the iterator on which it is called. It "works", but Valgrind gives you an error because in order to move the iterator forward after using it with erase, you rely on the next pointer of the node that was deleted in erase.</p></TEXT>

<p>How are we supposed to parse the input if we cant use c_strings? If i input 24 32 * (plus other numbers/characters) and it first stores a string "24 32 *" How do I separate 24, 32, and * (etc.)?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>You should stop reading in one "item" when you hit white space. </p>

<p>I am having trouble with the single print and top function.  I can call the single print once, but then if called again it causes the program to crash.  Also, after calling p, any other command results in a segmentation fault.

 <TEXT>
dynamic cast of pointers vs references</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>First, for this class you only need to worry about dynamic casting pointers.</p>
<p>Second, you can indeed dynamic cast references, but there is a problem. With a pointer, the cast can simply return 0 (NULL) to indicate a failed cast. The same is not true of references. A failed reference cast results in an exception being thrown of type std::bad_cast.</p>

stress testing with really big numbers</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I figured out that we get the right output for really large numbers until it is 11 digits large..</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>C++ numerical data types have minimum ranges guaranteed by the ANSI/ISO standard. Some implementations make the ranges bigger, but there is a limit at which point bad things will happen, typically "rolling over" back to 0.</p>

<p>The exact numbers used in the standard are around page 34 of <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf" target="_blank">this pdf</a> (page 20 of the actual report)</p>

<p>I think the project spec actually addresses this and states that you will not have issues as long as you keep your rationals reduced.</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>by "making the program run for a super long time," do you mean initiating the calc program and letting it sit there without necessarily any input for a long time, then checking for memory leaks with valgrind? like would we do ./calc then just let it sit there for awhile? or did you mean run a ton of commands? sorry, I'm just not quite sure what you meant by "run for a super long time"</p></TEXT>

<p>I have an assert statement at the beginning of my removeFront() that makes sure that the list is not empty. Everything works fine, however when I started writing my own list tests it keeps evaluating the assert statement before and after the last element is removed even though I only wrote it at the beginning of my function and it is therefore throwing an error that the list is empty, exiting my program. Is there something about assert that it constantly is evaluating the truth of it's predicate or is this something else?</p></TEXT>

Weird assert error</TEXT>

<p>So I think I had a similar error earlier today. I found that our destructor, which was calling removeAll, kept trying to delete more things than there actually were.

<p>Hello. I'm still having trouble parsing the user input. When I use getline, i have trouble separating the arguments by whitespace. When I use cin &gt;&gt; i am only able to read one argument at a time and not all of them. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thank you.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Having trouble parsing the input?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think using cin is a better approach than getline, but that's just my opinion. Why is it a problem that you can only read in one argument at a time? Couldn't you look at what you're getting and decide if it's a command or a piece of data and decide what to do with it from there?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thank you. The issue was that I had declared the stack after reading input so it as it read each command it was creating a new stack and "forgetting" the previous inputs to the stack.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>i see why using cin is the way to go, but how do we get it to read the next int or operator after we process the previous int or operator? The user input is a full command, not just a single int or operator correct?</p>

<p>Assume a destructor is needed, does it need to be virtual and why or why not?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
winter exam 1d</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But i can see a lot of virtual destructors in past exams.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My mistake. It actually depends on what is being inherited.  For any class that has dynamic memory you need a destructor and if it is being derived the destructor (and the destructors of all derived classes) needs to be virtual.  Any classes higher in the hierarchy do not need destructors (virtual or otherwise) since there is no dynamic memory to manage.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Your explanation makes sense, but from your logic, the answer is yes!</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No for the same reason constructors aren't. Destructors and constructors are specific to that class and get called automatically. You're not overriding anything bc a constructor for the base class doesn't have the same name as a constructor for the derived class.</p></TEXT>

<p>Quick question,</p>

<p>Is setting something to NULL the same thing as setting something to 0? And vice versa?</p>
<p>This in in regards to deleting something.</p>

<p>In lecture, we see the code:<br /><br />delete victim; victim = 0;</p>

<p>However, I've been hearing that you should set things to NULL instead. Just wondering if there's a difference / preference.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
0 vs. NULL</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>NULL is a macro that expands to 0. Its use is encouraged to communicate intent and improve readability.</p>
<p>In C++11, we have the new nullptr keyword as well, but this is out of the scope of this class.</p></TEXT>

<p>I'm having trouble looping my input stream such that it re-declares a stack and for each line of commands, it performs different operations. Right now, if i added say "2 2 +" as commands, it will keep the 4 in the stack for the next line of commands. Before, i was having the opposite problem where it would read the first "2" and declare a new stack and forget about it by the time it got to the next "2". Any suggestions for this? Thank you.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Re-declaring stack in calc.cpp</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>isn't the first thing what you want? you input 2 and then 2 and say add them so the only thing in your stack should be a 4 after that set of inputs, you should just have one stack object for the entire program and keep on adding stuff to it until the q command is entered</p></TEXT>

<p>I know the formulas we were given for +/-* don't always work properly so I was wondering if this is correct.</p>

<p>10/0</p>
<p>20/0</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>a</p>


<p>I receive 30. Is this correct or incorrect? Because my Rational_tests are working, and the only other thing I can think of that that could be the problem is the formulas..</p>

<p>Any help appreciated. Thanks.</p></TEXT>

<p>try looking at the specs or other piazza posts about infinity rational numbers </p>

<p>hint both of those rational numbers are really positive infinity and should be represented differently</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I didn't realize that you were trying to enter something, I thought you were talking about those were the rations you were trying to add. Sorry</p>

<p>the student answer is correct and so are you I don't think  we will ever have 10/0 be input that is suppose to be interpreted as an input number, but if you do the correct mathematical operations on numbers it could result in a ration object on the stack with the value of 10/0 in which case your overloaded operators should still produce the correct output</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Right - okay. I guess my question is irrelevant because 20/0 should never be directly entered, right?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would guess what's happening is your translation of the string to a rational is incorrect. I don't think we need to be able to input numbers to the stack as rationals though.</p>
<p>If you run this bit of code:</p>
<pre>char* c_str = "10/0";
int i = atoi(c_str);
cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;</pre>
<p>I suspect the output you'll get is 10, since atoi doesn't know how to handle '/'. You could parse the input string and split it around '/' characters, but considering it doesn't matter per the project spec I wouldn't bother.</p></TEXT>

test cases for big three and operators</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't think there will be any harm doing so, and definitely a good idea!</p>

<p>Someone else here:</p>
<p>The problem with testing for those operators is the fact that because they are not specified means that they could be implemented with any effect the author chooses.  For example, you might have written your iterator dereference function to return the value of the datum it points to.  Someone else could have written it to return the address of the datum it points to.  When compile-time happens, your code will be expecting the iterator dereference function to return a value, when it instead returns a pointer.  Then your code won't compile, and you'll probably be pretty sad to lose points.</p></TEXT>

<p>I suppose that if you kept the undefined iterator tests in a separate file from those that are defined you would have no problem if the code didn't compile</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sure, the particular tests for these would not compile for whatever reason if the files used by the graders do not contain the declarations, or if, as someone mentioned above, the operators are implemented in a different way (which I doubt). But in that situation, I personally don't think it would be problematic if these test cases fail to compile, since the rest of them would still work. Would I lose points, though?</p></TEXT>

<p>We used a recursive version of Euclid's algorithm for GCD. However, we receive a seg fault if we put in two numbers like 1000000 and 1, because the recursive algorithm calls itself thousands of times. So when we create a Rational object</p>

Readability</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
readability is more than just comments it's also how tour code is structured, do all your variable new make sense for what they do? does a single pine of code fit within the 80 character line limit, if it doesn't did you wrap it around to the next line appropriately? are you consistent with your code style curly braces in the same place all the time, and most importantly to someone who hasn't seen your code is it just easy to read and figure out what each part does both the what and why.</TEXT>

<p>When I use the sample input files, i use shell redirection to save the output somewhere and i run something like:</p>

<pre>delete i.node_ptr; i.node_ptr = 0;</pre>

Erasing and still having a valid node_ptr</TEXT>

<p>here's what you should do, make a test that makes a big list and then erases a bunch of stuff in the middle then check if you leak any memory, if you do then you're not cleaning up memory everywhere you should be, if not then you're all good.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The operations for removing stuff from the beginning and end of a list are more likely to crash your program with some sort of null pointer issues than mess things up silently. It doesn't hurt to check them though, just make sure that you're also trying to delete stuff that isn't just on the ends.</p></TEXT>

<p>Figured it out, apparently visual's compiler is slightly different from caen's on how it behaves. Like I stored the element of the top array in an iterator like this Iterator i = list.begin() then when I erased it by saying erase(list.begin()) and returned the dereferenced i, visual studio stopped the program and said it was a seg fault. I am not understanding why caen did not catch this. I found an alternative way to fix this which is by storing the element in an T type instead a iterator.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ah that makes sense. Visual studio in general is a bit more likely to warn you as you do things that don't make sense. Valgrind is even better about that sort of thing, but g++ itself can let you do some pretty crazy stuff depending on what flags you give it.</p></TEXT>

<p>I've been trying to check for memory leaked using valgrind. It seems that I loose the same amount of memory regardless of how many nodes I have. Also after removing the destructor, I am still leaking the exact same amount of memory regardless of how many nodes I have.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Memory Leak</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My first thought is that you have some random new keywords in your code, I would do some sort of find/replace to try and pick them out and make sure they're intentional. For clarity's sake, what class is this? I assume List, but if you're using dynamic memory somewhere else it could be another class.</p>

<p>The fact that you can delete the destructor and still have the issue though makes me think there might be some sort of abstraction behind the scenes with new (maybe malloc or something?) that doesn't necessarily guarantee the size of new memory. I have no idea if that's true or not but it might be something to look into (that the size of your leak may not always reflect the amount of things leaked, at least for small leaks). I'll try testing stuff out a bit and might update this later.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so from what I've tested with just integers, the size of the leak is the exact size of stuff leaked, which makes your problem a bit more confusing. It sounds likely that your destructor for the list isn't deleting a couple of the nodes, maybe the first and the last? How much memory is leaked?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm using integers and exactly 24 bytes are leaked, which is exactly one node's worth. I'm fairly sure that I am removing the last node.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I got it to work. I'm unsure why it wasn't working  it's likely that I was not recompiling List.h.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ah yes, this is List and had checked that all instances of new are intentional.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>say we have Iterator i; *i should point to a node-&gt;datum, NOT just a node, correct?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
question about * operator for iterators</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yep. The idea is to mirror what dereferencing a pointer does, since an Iterator is sort of a class "dressing up" as a pointer. Also, see the code that supplements the lecture slides (List.h) for confirmation. I assume we're supposed to follow that model.</p></TEXT>

<p>It helps to write or draw the stack out entry by entry. If you give the first input to the calculator program, here's what should happen:</p>

<p>Stack after seeing 1: [1]</p>
<p>Stack after seeing 0: [0 1]</p>
<p>Stack after seeing /: [1/0]</p>
<p>Stack after seeing 1: [1 1/0]</p>
<p>Stack after seeing 0: [0 1 1/0]</p>
<p>Stack after seeing /: [1/0 1/0]</p>
<p>Then when + is applied, you use the laws of arithmetic on rationals: (a/b) + (c/d) = (ad + bc)/bd. So we have 1/0 + 1/0 = (1*0 + 0*1)/(0 *0) = 0/0. </p>
<p>So the stack after seeing +: [0/0]</p>

<p>Hopefully that helps.</p></TEXT>

<p>If you're asking about output for when the denominator is negative - in that case remember that the first invariant of Rationals is that the denominator must always be greater than or equal to 0.

<p>Similarily for Rational_test00</p>
<p>when r is declared: r = Rational(2,4); The numerator comes out 6304616 and the denominator is 0. However, if we write the same assignment right below it, the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 2, which is correct. Anyone know what's going on?</p></TEXT>

<p>TLDR: the % means type it into a terminal, you don't include the %</p>


<p>The '%' symbol is one of several common symbols used to denote input to a shell, console or terminal. I'm pretty sure it's the default for C shell (often abbreviated "csh"). CAEN's version of linux, and most modern versions, use bash as the default shell ("<strong>b</strong>ourne <strong>a</strong>gain <strong>sh</strong>ell", a play of the name of an older shell "bourne shell" abbreviated "sh") Bash uses a '$' instead of '%'. To denote a shell with root access, '#' is typically used.</p>

<p>There's an environment variable on (linux at least) called PS1 that you can change the symbol with, or add cool stuff like information on the current directory the terminal is in.</p>

<p>The link you found was talking about a different programming language called Node.JS, which has a command line interface or "CLI", a way to use a programming language interactively.</p></TEXT>

<p>An iterator lets us limit how it's used. If we hadn't declared the List class a friend of the iterator, we wouldn't have even been able to access the pointer behind the iterator. It's basically another tool that we can use to abstract concepts and simplify them, the only really good example of this in the project is the for loop syntax we were able to use. Otherwise we would have had to write something along the lines of:</p>
<pre>Node* curr_node_ptr = list.first;<br />while(curr_node_ptr != list.last)<br />{<br />	// do stuff<br />	curr_node_ptr = curr_node_ptr-&gt;next;<br />}</pre>

<p>If we add infinity and infinity(1/0 + 1/0), the direct result from the definition of "+" will get 0/0. But, intuitively, I think the result should be infinity. What should be the correct result? Should I add is as an exception to the "+"? Thank you!</p></TEXT>

<p>There was a question in the 12pm lecture about functors and anonymous objects, and functors and pointers. Specifically, can you call the operator function-call on an anonymous object; and can you call the operator function-call on a pointer.</p>

<p>Here is sample code that has the answer to both questions:</p>

<p>class AbsValue {<br />public:<br />    int operator()(int i) {<br />         return i &gt; 0 ? i : -i; }<br />};<br /><br />int main( ) {<br />   int n = -123;<br />   AbsValue aObj;<br />   int abs_n = aObj(n);<br />   cout &lt;&lt; "n = " &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; " abs_n = " &lt;&lt;   abs_n &lt;&lt;endl;<br />  </p>
<p>   //create an AbsValue object, and immediately call the operator function-call</p>
<p>   int abs_m = AbsValue()(-4);<br />   cout &lt;&lt; "m = " &lt;&lt; -4 &lt;&lt; " abs_m = " &lt;&lt; abs_m &lt;&lt; endl;<br />  </p>
<p>   // a pointer to a functor; directly calling the operator function-call on the pointer,</p>
<p>   // using -&gt;, will not work</p>
<p>   AbsValue* pObj;<br />   int abs_p = (*pObj)(10);<br />   cout &lt;&lt; "p = " &lt;&lt; 10 &lt;&lt; " abs_p = " &lt;&lt; abs_p &lt;&lt; endl;<br />}<br /><br /></p>

<p>I don't believe that test file ends with a q, so that could be why your loop is continuing. You might want to consider changing your while loop to take in a string and check if it's VALID (not the end of the file) at the same time. Then you can have a case "q" like you have a case "+", etc. Maybe @2578 can help more.</p></TEXT>

<p>If we use erase(i), the Iterator i will then be invalidate since the node that i points to is deleted. Is this what we are supposed to implement erase()?</p></TEXT>

erase()</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm not entirely sure I understand the question, but if you're asking whether it's correct that the iterator passed to List::erase() is invalidated, that is true.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You definitely <em>shouldn't</em> call erase twice with the same iterator, and it would probably cause some memory errors since I expect it would be deleting the same part of memory multiple times. Weird things can happen though, it might work even though it's not supposed to. I don't think there's any checking for that, it's just something not to do.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Similarly, we cannot use ++i since the node that i points has been deleted. Am I correct?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>correct, you need to increment i before you delete what it used to point to.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>this means that we definitely can't call erase twice using the same iterator then?? (also, would we have to do any checking for this?</p>

 <TEXT>
Curiosity: Deleting the same dynamic twice</TEXT>

<p>As far as I've read it's undefined behavior. There are no guarantees on what will happen, which can make it an especially hard error to catch.</p></TEXT>

<p>If you were do do something like:</p>
<pre>delete np;
delete np;</pre>
<p>There would be an error stating that you are trying to free memory that is already freed (a double free).</p>
<p>Doing what you have is a way to enforce that double free from never happening as </p>
<p>delete 0;</p>
<p>is valid and won't change the program. In general though, it's best to avoid any chances to perform a double free.</p></TEXT>

Valgrind mumbo jumbo - Any help interpreting would be appreciated!</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It looks like there are some errors in your List::removeAll function. I suspect the invalid read is related to deleting the node the iterator is pointing to, so when the iterator's ++ operator tries to go to the node's next pointer, it's accessing memory that was deleted.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>correct, but I think the key part of that is <em>after</em> the ++.</p>
<p>It helps to think about what happens in a for loop. Take the following code:</p>
<pre>for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; 10 ; ++i)<br />{<br />	//do stuff<br />}</pre>
<p>The int is set to 0, then the condition is evaluated, then "stuff is done", and then finally the int is incremented.</p>
<p>If you approached the constructor the same way, I would guess you're deleting the iterator's node_ptr, then trying to access it again when you increment it. There are a few ways to design around this, I personally used a different type of loop that let me choose when I wanted to increment the iterator.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But in removeAll, shouldn't we be deleting the node_ptr after each ++ until it gets to end()?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>To build off the student answer, it looks like you're trying to remove too much. Looks how it says "All heap blocks were freed...".  Therefore, you are deleting everything and must be going "off the end" of your list.</p></TEXT>

<p>std::to_string is a c++11 feature, and is more than likely not supported by the version of the compiler used in this class.

<p>Hi Everyone</p>

<p>To mitigate students being confused why List_compile_check causes a segfault when run, I have re-uploaded a version of List_compile_check that won't segfault your program when running.</p>

<p>As stated in the Project Spec, this is <em><strong>not</strong> </em>supposed to be part of your test suite. This file only makes sure all your functions compile! </p>

<p>If you have already downloaded the file, then there is <strong>no need </strong>to re-download it. This serves all the same functionality as the previous List_compile_check!</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Updated List_compile_check.cpp - No need to redownload</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Just a quick question, in instances when you're trying to remove a node from a list and the list is empty, or when your iterator points to null and you call erase, what should your function do? Obviously it's bad access, but should I just call assert statements in order to try and protect against it? Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Checking Within Functions</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Alternatively, should erase do nothing? I'm just not sure.</p>


<p>----</p>

<p>You can't erase from an empty list. </p>
<p>You can't call erase on a NULL iterator.</p>
<p>The RME files protect against that.</p>

<p>You don't have to do anything, they won't try that. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Alternatively, should erase do nothing? I'm just not sure.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So use a conditional rather than an assert?</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If you pass an Iterator pointing to the "end" of the list to erase, your implementation should just do nothing.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Wait - why should it just do nothing? The RME says a valid iterator has to be passed in..can a valid iterator be null?</p></TEXT>

<p>Between the last assert(s.count_if(compareWithTwenty) ==0); statement and the test cases finishing, i am receiving an error on an assert statement i put into my removeFront function where if the list is empty, the assert statement triggers.</p>

<p>I don't understand what lines of code could possibly be running after this assert statement, however when i output something in the removeFront function, it outputs 8 times after the last assert statement of the test file. Why would the test file run this function 8 times? this is very odd to me</p>

<p>Well, there're two things here. First, I think we're here taught to write good classes. List is a general class, so it has to be able to do almost everything a list has to do, iterators included.

 <TEXT>
<p>Iterator is a subclass of list, so you should do "List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator List&lt;T&gt;::end() const"</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It depends on the return type of the function. For the compiler to know where to find the Iterator type, it has to be told it's a subclass of list. If you're returning an integer, the compiler already knows what that is. The compiler also knows where to find the List type, since it's on the same scope as our functions</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So after writing </p>

<p>template &lt;typename T&gt;<br />Iterator List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator List&lt;T&gt;::end() const</p>

<p>I still get the same error. Any ideas?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>leave out the initial iterator. It should be something like:</p>
<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt;<br />List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator List&lt;T&gt;::end() const</pre>
<p>unless I've made a terrible mistake</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry, but, again, this didn't work. I wonder what it is I need to change?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>add in a typename in front of it?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>That was it! Thanks! Why isn't it necessary though to have Iterator there is what I now don't understand (I guess it makes sense, because I didn't have it originally)?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So, we want a few things in a function declaration:</p>
<pre>return_type function_name (arg_type arg,...)<br />{<br />	// Return something with return type.<br />}</pre>
<p>A simple way of thinking about the scope resolution operator (::) is that it tells the compiler where to find something. There are some ways to change where the compiler will look*, but in general it will look in the global scope and in the local scope (someone correct me if I'm wrong, the rules can get weird).</p>

<p>The compiler can find things like int, void, double, bool, and other primitives without any problems. Things get more complex though when we do something like implement a class's member function outside of the class declaration.</p>

<p>Here's where our issue arises: the return type of our function, the Iterator type from List, is not declared in the global namespace, it's local to the List class. Since we're writing the function outside the List class, the Iterator type we want to use isn't local to where we're implementing it either. Why doesn't the compiler just look for an Iterator type somewhere? Well, what if we were also using an IntVector in this project with its own Iterator? We need to let the compiler know where we're getting this Iterator type from. We tell the compiler to find this type in a specific scope, the scope local to List in this case.</p>


<p>*Examples of other ways to change where the compiler is looking for stuff: "using namespace std" lets us leave off the std:: for functions in the standard namespace, like std::cout and std::endl. There's also a more complex system called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument-dependent_name_lookup" target="_blank">argument dependent name lookup</a> that lets you leave off the std:: from the operator &lt;&lt; when it's used with something like std::cout.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is this then necessary for all functions? Even though it seems to give no errors for other functions?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>

<p>From the outside word where list1 and list2 are instantiated, their private variables are not accessible by each other. The copy constructor is implementation code of the List class. In the implementation can obviously access private variables or else it couldn't implement the class.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
When to use the Big 3</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The way I've always understood it, is if you're using pointers, you'll likely need the big three because:</p>
<p>1: When assigning, you want the left hand object to have the same values as the right hand one, even if the right hand one gets deallocated.  Just copying the pointer values means that one object could free the memory that the other is using)</p>
<p>2:  When copy constructing, same as above.</p>
<p>3:  When deleting,  you don't want to leave any unpointed heap memory around.</p>

<p>Now, there are other pointers (outside of the scope of this class, I believe) called smart pointers.  These clever little guys keep track of what they point to.  Once all the smart pointers that point to a memory address stop pointing there (either because the smart pointers go out of scope, or because you change where they point), then the memory is automatically freed.  In this case then, you wouldn't need to worry about freeing the pointers during destruction (IE, one of the big three), because you know when the object is destroyed, then the pointers will be out of scope and the memory will automatically be freed.</p></TEXT>

<p>I don't believe it is a valid iterator because the end iterator simply points to NULL. Each iterator in the list points to a "node" of sorts that contains some kind of datum that can be obtained if you dereference the iterator, but the end iterator does not have a datum associated with it.</p>

<p>I didn't have any cases to account for that, but I could be mistaken.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>A NULL iterator is valid. You can insert into an empty list, and thus the iterator would point to NULL.</p>

<p>An invalid iterator is one that points to a place in memory where a node once was.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thank you! Helped out on the 'valid iterator' definition, but I guess I'm still confused on the end edge case. I overheard a discussion during office hours on the implementation of this edge case, and it seemed as if it was necessary. But, as the student answer explained, that would require the iterator to point to NULL, which isn't valid.  Any help on understanding this would be much appreciated!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Remember an empty list is a valid list and a NULL iterator on list.begin will indicate an empty, yet a NULL iterator on list.end may indicate either an empty list or not.</p></TEXT>

<p>The comments in the .h file recommend that we test the Top to ensure the user doesn't change the Stack when calling the Top function. How do we do test for this?

 <TEXT>
Testing Top</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<pre>//...Note: Since a reference is returned, potentially, the caller
  // can use the call to change the top without doing a pop/push. You should
  // test for that in your tests.</pre>
<p>I'm assuming this is the comment in question? I took it to mean that we <em>could</em> change the Stack when calling Stack::top, but there's a chance I misinterpreted it.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think it means that you should test to make sure you can change the top element on the stack if you want. Try something like:</p>
<pre>Stack&lt;int&gt; s;<br />s.push(5);<br />cout &lt;&lt; s.top(); // Should print 5<br />s.top() = 4;<br />cout &lt;&lt; s.top(); // Should print 4</pre>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I may be confused here but it looks to me like you're saying that we should not be able to change the Stack with Stack::top. I'm saying that it looks like we should be able to do so. Testing whether or not we can change it is pretty easy</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Oh, I didn't realize that it meant we should allow for the user to change the top value. Thanks for the help!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ahhh you're posting faster than I can answer :D! Tara and Andrew are correct - you should test to make sure you can use top to modify the top element. The stack itself is not really changed by top, but the element at the top is certainly changeable.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, that's the comment. I thought the same as you, but I don't know how to actually test for that. I make sure not to change anything when calling Top(), but the comment suggests that we should have a test cases that checks to ensure that nothing was changed after calling Top, and apart from popping everything off the Stack to check that nothing was changed, I'm not sure how to test it.</p></TEXT>

<p>Remember the iterator basically goes through the pointers using the "next" member in the Node. Although last=last-prev. What does last-&gt;next point to after that statement? It should be NULL, but perhaps its not.</p></TEXT>

<p>I just wanted to check that my logic was okay with the following:</p>

<p>1. if you have two iterators set to the end of two separate lists, is it right in saying iterator1 == iterator2, because they're both null?</p>
<p>2. similarly, is it right to say that iterator1 == iterator2 when both are set to the beginning of empty lists, because again they are both null?</p>

<p>It's actually kind of frowned upon to have "using namespace std", mainly because you could have some issues with using the wrong functions (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2712076/how-to-use-an-iterator/2712125#2712125" target="_blank">this stack overflow post</a>)</p>

<p>It's even more frowned upon to use it in a header file, because when you include the header it carries the "using namespace std" along with it into the main program. It doesn't matter a lot for something simple like this project, but best practices are to not do it.</p></TEXT>

erase on NULL iterator</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>"delete" by default does that check so there is nothing wrong with deleting a NULL pointer, of course the issue is that if you call something like ptr-&gt;next or ptr-&gt;datum and the ptr is NULL then you'll have yourself a segfault.</p></TEXT>

<p>how would you go about checking if an iterator points to NULL in erase? i.node_ptr == NULL does not work..</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>nevermind.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>^Actually, I would love clarification on that. How would you check if an iterator points to NULL?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
I simply declared another Iterator without initializing it since the default constructor should create an iterator that points to NULL, then i compared it with i. </TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Another way you can do it:</p>
<pre>if (!i.nodePtr) { /* do something */ }</pre>
<p>This just checks if the Iterator i's nodePtr actually points to something, since a NULL pointer is the same as 0.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Can you do that? I thought nodePtr was private so you couldn't access it if you were testing the Iterator i in List_testNN</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Oh, I meant for the actual implementation of the erase function - if you first wanted to check the validity of the Iterator's node pointer. You're right though; outside of the class definition you can't access the nodePtr.</p></TEXT>

<p>In Stack.h I made the ostream function a friend in the Stack Class:</p>

<p>My Question is I am not able to you an interator in the 'count_if' member function of Stack.h :</p>

<p>I am using an iterator on line 191 of Stack.h:</p>
<p>  for(typename List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator it = list.begin(); it!= list.end(); ++it)</p>

<p>and I am getting the following compiler error:</p>
<p><br />List.h: In member function ‘int Stack&lt;T&gt;::count_if(Predicate) const [with Predicate = bool (*)(int), T = int]’:<br />Stack_test00.cpp:58: instantiated from here<br />List.h:135: error: ‘bool List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator::operator!=(List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator) const [with T = int]’ is private<br />Stack.h:191: error: within this context<br />Stack_test00.cpp:58: instantiated from here<br />List.h:106: error: ‘List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator&amp; List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator::operator++() [with T = int]’ is private</p>

<p>Should we do #define NDEBUG to disable asserts, or do we need to remove all assert statements from the files?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
disable asserts</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>At first, we used #define NDEBUG. But because we were using NDEBUG in .h files and "#include"ing those in our tests, it was disabling all of our asserts in our tests, which caused all of our tests to pass no matter what. So the moral of the story is, if you use asserts in your tests, be careful using NDEBUG!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hmm, that's a good point. You're probably right, though we ended up deleting our asserts to be extra safe. Perhaps an instructor can provide more clarity.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Besides for our testing, where doing this disables all asserts, does defining NDEBUG actually have any negative impact on the project because it gets defined in List.h, and buggy List.h files are used with our test cases, so there really should be no impact on the test cases, as long as it is not defined in the test case, right?</p></TEXT>

<p>The RME for erase() only requires that i be a valid iterator. I've seen it mentioned in several posts that an iterator that points to NULL (points "past the end") is indeed a valid iterator. What, then, should the specific behavior for the erase() function be when used with an iterator that points past the end? The effects clause just says the function will remove an item in the list. How do we determine what item to remove if the iterator points to NULL? What should happen if the List is empty? Or should the function do nothing in either case? I guess I'm just a little confused by the wording in the RME. Any help or clarification would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p></TEXT>

<p>The autograder calc tests will follow similarly to the calc_test01.in and calc_test02.in files you were given. </p>

<p>That being said, I think it's fair game to say that a few autograder test cases will contain a 'q' just to test that you implemented the 'q'. </p>

<p>So to answer your second question at the same time: Yes, you will have to find a way to stop when the input reaches to the end of the file. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>remember that you are NOT reading from a file specifically you are reading from standard input so just make your program only end if a q is inputted, for this project that is how we are telling the program to stop expecting more input. </p>

<p>As detailed in a couple of previous posts, it's probably easiest to read in strings, since reading in characters would be difficult for numbers that have multiple digits, etc. The nice thing is that the spec states that you can assume that you'll be given valid input for the tests (re: question 2) so you don't have to worry about bad input checking. You can just check to see if the string entered is equal to one of the calculator's character commands, and if it's not you can cast the input to an integer and go from there.</p></TEXT>

<p>Regarding your first question: if a class has one or more pure virtual functions then it's an interface or Abstract Base Class (ABC) - is that what you meant?

For example, I'm looking over the Spring 14 final now and Problem 4 has an abstract base class called Robot with an overloaded constructor (no default ctor, but I suppose it could have one too). It's just that you can't actually instantiate an object of the Robot class, but you can make a Robot* and make it point to an object of a derived class. </p>

<p>error: no matching function for call to 'List&lt;int&gt;::removeFront() const'</p>
<p>note: candidates are: T List&lt;T&gt;::removeFront() [with T = int] &lt;near match&gt;</p>

<p>what is the difference between what I am trying to call and what it wants me to call?</p>

<p>EDIT: Should have specified. The error is not in the declaration of removeFront. the error line is what I am trying to call by putting the line</p>
<p>T g = l.removeFront();</p>

<p>I don't know where the const came from, it's not in my declaration or definition of the function, nor in the line i call it in.</p></TEXT>

<p><span style="text-decoration:line-through">It looks like you have a mismatch between the signatures of the declaration and definition of your List::removeFront() function. When you implemented List::removeFront() did you add a const keyword afterwards? You probably don't want that, considering you're removing the front item of the List.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:line-through">Throwing that theory out the window, I would try throwing a typename keyword in front of the T.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:line-through">You mention this is testing copyAll, is the function being called internally by copyAll or externally from your test driver?</span></p>

<p>I doubt the typename fixed anything, it probably just caused another error that masked the first one up. I think I see what's happening now though.</p>

<p>The mysterious const comes from the fact that the list you're copying nodes from is const (isn't it?). The no matching function issue probably stems from this, since you can't remove something from a constant list.</p>

<p>I doubt you want to remove the nodes from that list at all, there's no real reason to is there? List::copyAll's RME doesn't say anything about removing the values from the old list (although I can see where confusion could arise).</p></TEXT>

<p>I personally would consider using an iterator, but you have the general idea down.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I had thought since the list is constant, I could remove elements from the list freely without actually changing the list, just the version I have. So instead of removing all of them, would it be a better idea to instead just keep using the next pointer inside of node to keep going across all the nodes until next = 0?</p></TEXT>

<p>Since constructors (both copy and default) and assignment operator overloads are optional, will testing them cause good implementations to fail?  Should we test them at all?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Testing the Big Three and Default Constructors</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I don't think so. The comments of the starter file say that "a user of the class must be able to create, copy, assign, and destroy Lists." So I am pretty sure you need to test that you can create, copy, assign, and destroy Lists no matter what.</p>

<p>From my understanding, the "optional" bit about adding ctors, an overloaded assignment operator, and so on was to suggest that if your implementation worked correctly (no memory leaks, does what it should, etc) using the compiler-provided versions, then you didn't need to implement a default constructor, overload the assignment operator, and so on.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So in the given calc test, the input of </p>

<p>1 2 3 r a / a </p>
<p>c</p>

<p>which results in</p>

<p>2 3 1 <br />3/2 1 </p>

<p>I am not sure how it would result in this as it seems that all of the other tests refer to the top of the stack as the last elements.  I get that the reverse results in the 2 3 1, but I am not sure when dividing then results in the 3/2 1.  Any clarification is appreciated, thanks in advance.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Calc.cpp input</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So after the first three numbers, the stack is [3 2 1]. After seeing reverse, the stack is [2 3 1]. Then when the stack sees the / operator, the first number (2) is popped, the second number (3) is popped, then as per the spec we "divide the second value popped number by the first and push the result onto the top of the stack." So 3 divided by 2 is 3/2, and this result is pushed back on the stack, resulting in [3/2 1].</p>

<p>I hope that helps!</p></TEXT>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Hm, I didn't actually think about that. Let's see; I think the idea is if you insert from the back, you should also remove from the back. Like in that case, typing 1 2 3 into calc should make the stack [1 2 3]. Then if you want to pop two numbers, you have to start from the back; in that case the reverse command would result in a stack if [1 3 2]. In the spec it says "to push, add an element at one end of the list...to pop, remove the element from the same end of the list." So either way I think it would work out as long as you're pushing/popping consistently from the same end.</p>

<p>I actually never considered pushing from the back so hopefully this makes sense to you.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Oh wait and I think the other thing is if you choose to push/pop from the end, you might have to do a little changing around stuff to get the stack printing operations right? Just a thought.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Whichever end you start on, front or back, make sure you always add and remove from the same end.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>thanks for the help, its greatly appreciated!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so for pop and push, do you insert into the back or insert into the front? Currently I am inserting in the back, but it appears as if you insert in the front?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How do you push a zero onto a list? We've noticed that when we attempt to push a zero onto the stack through calc.cpp that it doesnt appear when printing the list.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>
<p>2 0 2 a</p>

<p>gives</p>
<p>2 2.</p>

<p>In list we use zero to show that a pointer such as prev or next is at the end and does not point to another node. If this node equals zero, how do we get it to link into the list?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Pushing zero</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>the pointer to the node won't be 0, rather the datum value will be 0. The node will still have an existing address, and should be able to be pointed to. The datum value will be what is 0.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm fairly sure atoi can convert a "0" char* to an integer representation of 0. If you solved the problem no big deal, but there might be some other issues going on.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Are we allowed to use Atoi(variable.c_str())?</p>
<p>What is c_str() from?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>c_str is a member function of the string object.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yes you are allowed to use atoi( variable.cstr() ) and that's how I would do it. and it should be able to convert "0" to an int 0 so you might want to re-check how you are handling input</p>

<p>c_str() is a member variable of the std string class which is from #include &lt;string&gt; which is one of the libraries you are allowed to include for the project</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>We found out it was an issue with our calc function. Atoi was not converting 0 to an int and so it wasn't being pushed. We added an extra if statement for when 0 is inputted and directly pushed 0 on the stack.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How are we to recognize if input is a number? I understand for string we have == to check what we might expect, but for numbers it could be a multitude of things.</p>
<p>I've used the funciton isdigit(input), but that gives the error:</p>

<p> cannot convert std::string to int for argument 1 to int isdigit(int)</p>

<p>Any advice?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
calc.cpp - recognizing a number as input</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm not very familiar with isDigit, but from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cctype/isdigit/">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cctype/isdigit/</a>, it looks like it is meant to take the first character from a char*, cast as an int, and return true if it's a digit.</p>

<p>This works pretty well because characters are more or less integers in c++. If you look up an <a target="_blank" href="http://benborowiec.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/better_ascii_table.jpg">ASCII table</a> it will show you what values different characters are represented as. I'm also not sure that header is allowed for the project, but I didn't check so if you know it is go ahead.</p>

<p>EDIT: on another note, you could just loop through all of the letter possibilities, and if it is none of those then it must be a number. They have said they won't ever input something unexpected.</p></TEXT>

<p>Oh, right thanks. We did it before we noticed they wouldn't give us anything incorrect.</p></TEXT>

<p>from the specs you are guaranteed only valid input so if it's not one of the command for a calculator function then because all the input is valid you are left with the fact that it must be a number, try structuring your code to this logic</p></TEXT>

<p>In our code, we rely on our rational number constructors to make sure every rational number created is in reduced form. This includes when new rational numbers are created through additional, subtraction, etc.</p>

<p>Do we have to worry about our overloaded operators for +, -, etc. being tested against an invalid constructor that doesn't reduce properly?</p>

<p>In other words, does every function and overloaded operator that returns a rational number need to check by itself if the rational number is actually reduced? Or can they rely on a single source (in our case the constructors) to make sure the numbers are reduced?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Checking to make sure rational numbers are reduced</TEXT>
 <TEXT>

Using count_if</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From what the other questions have said, I believe the best method of going about this is using a functor. Create the functor with the value you want to compare the rationals to, then pass in the class itself into count_if. If your functor had an operator() override and was named matchN, you could create matchN m and then call count_if as count_if(m) and m would be your predicate.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
I passed all tests in the autograder at one point, but I changed my code a little and theres extra spaces and a mysterious newline that I cant' figure out.  I am confused as for the inputs, do they all just go together at once?  When I do that, my program is off by a couple spaces and a line at the start.  If the autograder inputs line by line, my program works correctly</TEXT>

<p>In calc.cpp, I'm using a string for all my inputs.</p>
<p>Can numbers be strings? like "0" or "9"?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
string question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes numbers can be strings, since strings are just sequences of characters and characters include numbers. If you want to convert a string to a number for the purposes of this project, you can do something like this:</p>
<pre>string s = "1";<br />int x = atoi(s.c_str()); // x is now 1</pre>
<p>The part in parentheses, s.c_str() converts the string s to a const char*, since that is what the function atoi from &lt;cstdlib&gt; expects as input.</p></TEXT>

<p>There seems to be conflicting statements about disabling assert statements. In stack, some of the requires clauses require you to have assert statements, so turning off the assert statements seem to violate this. And putting #define DNDEBUG in list.h, disables the assert statements in the test cases as another piazza post said. This should be fine, after all testing is done, but I just wanted to make sure, this is correct.</p>


<p>So my actual question is should we do #define DNDEBUG in stack even though it would technically violate the requires clause?</p></TEXT>

<p>You should probably implement Stack::top or at least write a stub function for it (something that will compile but not necessarily do anything). It looks like your first problem is that your List::Iterator operator overloads are private. You probably want them to be public.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Based on the description of your errors, I would go check a few things.</p>
<p>It seems that you are trying to use overloaded operators for iterator, but you did not declare them as public.</p>
<p>Also it seems you are trying to use private member *note_ptr directly instead of using it through dereference. </p>
<p>And at some point you used post increment for your iterator, while the overloaded one is pre-increment.</p>
<p>That's all what I guessed based on your error list, hope it could be helpful.</p></TEXT>

returning *this</TEXT>

<p>When we use the incrementation operator we often want to store the result. Not only does the operator modify the Iterator, it returns itself afterwards. When you compare it to something like an int this makes a lot of sense. For example take something like:</p>
<pre>int count = 0;<br />int first_count = ++count; // 1<br />assert(first_count == 1);<br />assert(count == 1);<br />int second_count = ++count // 2
assert(second_count == 2);
assert(count == 2);</pre>
<p>This isn't really used by the project, but it can be useful in something like a while loop where you may be calculating something while you eventually will need to increment a counter.</p></TEXT>

<p>r1 will be simplified to 1/1, and multiplying r2 by r1 1000 times won't actually increase r2 to potentially overflow it. If my Rational constructors simplify the fraction atomatically, how can I test for overflow?</p></TEXT>

<p>Using this input "1 2 3 0 a" it prints the output "1489667192/32767 3 2 1"</p>

<p>The numerator of the weird number seems to be different each time, but the denominator is consistently 32767.</p>

 <TEXT>
Adding 0 to the stack</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would explore your Rational constructor and make sure you're GCD is something reasonable for 0. I'd also run it through valgrind for good measure.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Found the problem, tried to call the default constructor in the custom constructor when the only input was 0, so it never initialized numerator and denominator.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I changed my gcd helper function so that if one of the values is 0 to return 1.</p>

<p>So now I don't get a random fraction, but it instead just adds to the stack the previous value in the stack again.</p>
<p>ex: input: "3 5 7 0 5 a" </p>
<p>      output: " 5 7 7 5 3"</p>

<p>Hello, all! For my print all function, there is a problem where entering the following produces a segfault:</p>

<p>1 2 / 1 2 / + a</p>

<p>The segfault happens at 'a', and I used a debugger to find that the iterator for printing the stack was going beyond the size of the stack. The first element if (1/1) (Which is correct for this), but then it goes and tries to print (637940 / 0) and then an undefined rational which causes the segfault. If someone could help me find a problem here, I would really appreciate it, since I'm not sure what could be causing this. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Iterator for printing stack goes off end!</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>1) It seems like you found the problem yourself - you're going off the end. How can you control this? Is the problem somewhere else, such as in List?</p>

<p>2) Running through Valgrind should tell you where and when the first invalid read occurs.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You run it in the shell (ex. ./calc &lt; infile ) and it segfaults, but when you run it through valgrind (ex. valgrind ./calc &lt; infile) and it runs perfectly? That's very strange. You may want to come into office hours for this if you still can't figure out why you're going off the end.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Marking as resolved - let me know if you have any additional questions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I ran it through valgrind, but it completes everything without any segfault. Is this supposed to happen, or is my code just not working when I actually run it regularly?</p></TEXT>

<p>Segfaults usually happen when you're doing something weird in memory (i.e. trying to access somewhere you shouldn't)</p>

<p>Debugging Segfaults can usually be found by running Valgrind. That being said, you may still need to go through it with a debugger (i.e. GDB) and see what's going on.</p></TEXT>

<p>so for the second answer why is it </p>
<p>false </p>
<p>true </p>
<p>true</p>

<p>…If the Blockbill function returns true (second line of output), then the last one must return false, right? </p>
<p>I mean because according to the PassBill RME ( it says if even one congressman blocks the bill then the bill does not pass) …doesn't that mean that  if the second line of code is true…the last must be false?</p>

<p>can someone please explain this to me!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Winter exam 3d</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Because when the blockBill function is called for Drew when the virtual is deleted, it uses the function in senator because drew is a senator. But when you are in the passBill function you are looking at a List of congressmen so it will use the congressmen blockBill which always returns false no matter who it is for since virtual is gone.</p></TEXT>

Memory leaks in buggy code?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>@2295, it shouldn't matter.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Possibly, but indirectly. You should only test what's in the public interface; through that, you may find memory leaks. </p>

<p>Your main objective should be to test the public functions within List and verify their behavior is correct.</p>

<p>Not sure what you meant by invariants; could you elaborate on that below? If you mean invariants by the general correctness of List, then yes, you should be testing that List behaves as promised.</p></TEXT>

<p>I got segfault when I call the insert function that uses iterator to insert a datum. It will only say segfault when I compile it with -O1, but when I compile it with -g it works perfectly. When I use visual studio it also runs without error. I tried to use gdb to find the bug, and it seems there is something wrong inside my insert function, but it wouldn't let me go further as it says "Missing separate debug infos". I double checked every line to make sure that I only call prev and next whenever the node is not NULL and now I really don't know what to do. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Iterator insert() segfault</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>1) If it works with certain flags and not others, I've found that it is most likely a memory bug.</p>

<p>2) When you run it through GDB, are you compiling with -g first? (Can't run it through with -O1)</p>

<p>3) Have you tried Valgrind yet?</p>

<p> </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This looks like an error report for a memory leak, not a segfault. Can't really tell much besides that from the error report. </p>

<p>So here are some additional ideas for when you might get a segfault for insert:</p>

<p>1) If the item passed in if the first item, then do not try to access the previous item.</p>

<p>2) Likewise if it's the last, then don't try to access the next item</p>

<p>3) Also make sure you're handling if it's both the first AND last item (i.e. it's the only item in the list)</p>

<p>4) Verify you are setting next and prev correctly for each node</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You mentioned you check if next or prev are null, then you don't check it. However, make sure you're setting next/prev to null during a delete (this goes back to my 4th item above)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>(As appropriate of course. So for example, if I have 0 1 2, and I delete 0, then I should make sure the prev of 1 is set to NULL, and 1 is the first item)</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>But the erase function (which is where the delete happens) has no error or memory leak whatsoever. The test code I wrote for insert is starting on an empty list, and inside insert function I first make a new nodeptr, but which points gets pointed to it is then decide by if the iterator node_ptr has a prev or not (If iterator node_ptr itself is not a NULL, then it must have a prev, and itself can serve as the next for my newly created np. If the iterator node_ptr itself points to NULL, then it is either an empty list or its at the end of a non-empty list). </p>
<p>However, it seems that the valgrind is telling me my newly created node_ptr is leaked because it depends on if/else statement to determine which pointer gets pointed to it. But I double checked that in each condition there will be two pointers in my list get pointed to it/ And this might makes sense because under -g flag the program can exit normally. Do you have any idea?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Here's something to remember; when valgrind tells you you're leaking memory, it will tell you where you are allocating memory (insert), not where you <strong>aren't</strong> deleting it (dtor, I'm assuming). </p>

<p>Quick question; are you getting a memory leak, or a segfault? (or both?) Because from your valgrind output, I didn't see any segfault.</p>

<p>As far as memory leaks, are you sure you're deleting everything you create? Running it with -g and -O1 should make no difference whatsoever in the operations of your program.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Marking as resolved- Let me know if you have any additional questions.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I tried it through GDB with both -g and -O1, but the very first time was -O1.</p>
<p>When using -g, GDB report the program exit normally, but -O1 directly jump into a seg fault.</p>
<p>Valgrind report no memory leak and no error for -g but report error for -O1.</p>

<p>1) Making things a friend doesn't change the public interface. What we mean when we say not to do that is "Don't add random functions and make them public. Also don't change the implementation of the functions we gave you so that they do something wacky."</p>

<p>2) because then you wouldn't be able to do something like: cout &lt;&lt; stack. Also I don't know if you can make operator&lt;&lt; a member function, and if you could how you would call it. For the sake of argument (of I don't know how to code it that way), if you were to make a print function that did the same thing, and you called it print(), you would have to do something like stack.print() to print the stack.

 <TEXT>
<p>There shouldn't be functions added to the public interface of the List, other than the big 3 if you need them. Your check invariants and print functions will have to be private in the List, or not in the List at all.</p>

<p>Note that outside of the List, the functions will not have access to the List's internal state unless you declare them as friends, but I don't know if that's allowed. It might cause errors when you try and link your version of Lists.h with the test cases on the autograder, and it will <em>definitely</em> cause problems when your tests are linked with buggy List.h implementations that almost surely don't have the friend declarations you would be relying on.</p></TEXT>

<p>A predicate is a function that takes an argument and returns a bool. I'm not sure if you're actually passing a bool as pred in Stack_test but I doubt it because if(pred(*i)) wouldn't work either in that case. Your first version of count if might work if the function were count_if_equals, but the idea is that you pass a function to count if, and it counts the number of things in the stack that cause that function to return true.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Ok, so if i am understanding it.  As I use my iterator in the count_if function within Stack.h, for each iteration, it calls my Pred function in Calc.  and uses the iterated object as the agruement, which returns a bool to the count_if function in Stack.h?</p></TEXT>

<p>i  = list.end()</p>

<p>for number 6:</p>

<p>A *a3= new A(NULL);</p>

<p>runs ctor: A(int *ptr_in) : ptr(ptr_in){};</p>

<p>so now *a3= new (null ptr)</p>

<p>How would you correctly deallocate memory here?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
winter exam 1f</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think you have some incorrect thinking in your last line "*a3 = new (null ptr)"</p>

<p>When you call A(NULL), per the A constructor, you set the member variable "ptr" to be equal to NULL. This does not turn A into a null pointer.</p>

<p>To deallocate the memory, think about what type of variable a3 is. Since we used the "new" keyword when declaring a3, a3 is a dynamic variable stored on the heap. The destructors of dynamically allocated variables will only be called if we, the user, specifically make a call to them. How do we do this? By calling "delete a3".</p>

<p>What happens now?</p>
<p>When we call "delete a3", a3's destructor now runs. Within the destructor, we see that the memory (on the heap) pointed to by the member variable "ptr" is being deallocated. Now remember, that ptr points to NULL (0). It is legal in C++ to call "delete" on a null pointer (which is why you often see the safety line: "delete ptr; ptr = 0;"). Thus, the destructor calls "delete ptr" to free the memory stored at ptr.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
Big Three</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You could probably do it. I don't think it's necessarily a good idea though. Your assignment operator typically returns a reference to "this", and you may be able to return a reference to the list you just constructed but I'm not sure you wouldn't run into issues. Also it saves maybe a line of code from being rewritten, so the gains aren't really justified (in my opinion)</p></TEXT>

<p>I wouldn't do that. What about all the stuff it is currently pointing to?</p>

<p>I believe you are correct up to the point right after you output "CAUGHT". When the "catch(GoodybeError x) {}" is completed, execution will return right after our catch statement.

The line after hello(); is cout &lt;&lt; done, and we continue along the main function. </p></TEXT>

<p>Here's a bit of "inspiration" to get you through studying these last 36 hours before the exam! Happy studying!</p>

<p>What exactly is the problem with protected member variables? From the lecture slides, it seems that the problem is that it is easy to use or change only the variables that the programmer or user wants to change directly without changing other variables (e.g. acute in Lecture 11) that also need to change with the desired variables. Is this the issue? Are there other problems with protected variables beyond this?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Protected Member Variables</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>They showed that you might forget to reset acute to -1.0 when you change something. They did that for efficiency reasons which you will go into more in 281.</p></TEXT>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>I'm doing lab12 and at the very end of task 2, we're supposed to write code in int main() to call the functor to identify people of age 16.</p>

<p>My code looks like </p>

<pre>IsAgeN is1(16);
identify(people, N, is1);</pre>

<p>however the compiler doesn't like it because it says there's no match for call</p>

<p>In function 'void identify(const Person*, int, Predicate) [with Predicate = IsAgeN]':</p>
<p>error: no match for call to '(IsAgeN) (const Person&amp;)'</p>
<p>note: candidates are: bool IsAgeN::operator()(const Person *)</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>When the virtual keyword for blockBill is removed, I don't understand why the last line would evaluate to true.

Winter 3d</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>in passBill we are inserting USCongress as a parameter, which is a linked list container filled with Congressman pointers. So, the static type would be congressman, but the dynamic type would be depending on what was inserted. So since we are removing the virtual keyword in the blockBill, it would return false. </p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>You'd want to have your destructors virtual if you are dealing with dynamic memory in your member variables and you have derived types. </p>

<p>A good illustration for this would be if you had the static type of the object an animal, but the dynamic type was a chicken. If chicken was allocating some new dynamic memory, you'd most certainly want the destructors to be virtual to properly handle those new memory. </p></TEXT>

I just went through the labster for winter 14 problem 4 and for the function apply(), a functor is returned at the end. In labster, there is code that this functor is inserted into that looks like:
Functor(Functor &amp;other) : mod_value(other.mod_value), num_values(other.num_values), sum(other.sum) {}
Where did this code come from and how does it create the functor that apply returns?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
winter 14 problem 4 e</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Good question. It's the implicitly defined copy constructor provided by the compiler. When a function returns something by value, a copy is made (just like in passing something by value). If the object returned is of class type, a copy constructor is used to create a temporary copy of the object, which is returned.</p>

<p>I just posted a modified version of the BigThree example from lab 10 (called "final_BigThree") that includes passing function arguments and returns with objects. You can skip through the code to the next pause() function using the run button - after the 3rd one, func1 and func2 are called and illustrate when the copy constructor and when it isn't (i.e. when passing/returning by value but not when doing so by reference).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In the lecture, it only says that you need to add it when needed. The detail is too complicated.</p>

<p>When is it needed? Sometimes the compiler can go thought the compilation with or without "typename" some times not. For example, in P5, when I run make my-tests locally, it success fully did the compilation with sentences "typename List&lt;int&gt;::Iterator itor". But in the autograder, it just fails. </p>

<p>I am really confused. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
when should I add a "typename" besides the template?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In general, <tt>typename</tt> is only required when you will use a templated Iterator and not one where the type that will be contained is known at the declaration time. This is an example of how it should be used:</p>
<pre>typename List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator i;<br />List&lt;int&gt;::Iterator i;<br />List&lt;double&gt;::Iterator i;</pre>

<p>i would say yes, it is the same as the other, but you have to remember the proper parentheses with the first one. It should be written as (**i).vote(billCost). Without the parenthesis around the i, you might get an error such as "no member named vote in 'List&lt;Congressman *&gt;::Iterator. </p></TEXT>

<p>I'm having issues checking my code with labster, it may be an error in my code. This is a portion of what I have: </p>

<p>Node *np= new Node</p>
<p>np-&gt;datum=*vec.data;</p>

<p>Labster just gets stuck on the second line. It seems that np contains the address of prev on the heap, and cannot access the datum element of node. Am I doing something wrong here?</p>

<p>thanks!</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
winter 2b</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So data is a private member variable (a pointer to a dynamic array) inside of IntVector, and in the copy constructor in question 2b, we are actually passing in an IntVector by reference.You don't want to dereference vec here. </p>

<p>So for example, if you wanted the node that np is pointing to to have the same datum as the first element in the data array, you would say:</p>

<p>np-&gt; datum = vec.data[0];</p>

<p>There is more to the question though, as you have to fill the IntList with all of the data ints in the IntVec, and you also have to set the proper node pointers that are seen in a linked list. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>edit: didn't mean to have the vec.data++ in there</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>From looking at your code, there are a couple of things that are missing:</p>

<p>1. Since we are dealing with a constructor, we will most likely initialize some member variables. As such, it is in your best interest to initialize first and last to something. </p>

<p>2. After your else statement things look fine. But before that, you are forgetting to to initialize np's previous and next. </p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm still getting the same issue when I make that change. I think I'm doing something conceptually wrong, but I cannot figure out what it is. </p>

<p>class IntList {<br /> Node *first, *last;<br /> <br /> IntList(const IntVector &amp;vec) <br /> {<br />    for(int i=0;i&lt;vec.numElements;i++){<br />         Node *np= new Node;<br />         np-&gt;datum=vec.data[i];<br />         if(i==0){<br />            first=last=np;<br />          }<br />        else{<br />           last-&gt;next=np;<br />           np-&gt;prev=last;<br />           last=np;<br />        }<br />   vec.data++;<br /> }<br /> <br /> }</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Sorry that was my bad. I had something that looked like this in Labster's code:</p>

<p>Why is the correct answer adding "friend class IntList" to IntVector, rather than the other way around(adding "friend class IntVector" to IntList)? Isn't IntList the class that's trying to access IntVector's private variables?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Winter 2a</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're correct in saying that IntList is the class that's trying to access IntVector's private members.</p>

<p>Based on how the "friend" system works in C++, you must include "friend class IntList" in IntVector's definition. </p>

<p>The lecture slides give a good way to remember this with: "friendship is something given, not taken". Check out Lecture 20 Slides 32 and 33 for more info on how friend classes work in C++.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p></TEXT>

<p>Just to make sure I understand correctly: default copy constructors and assignment operators not implemented by a programmer do not make new copies of dynamic memory when copying classes because that dynamic memory is not a member of the class, but is merely pointed to by another class member variable. The dynamic memory is on the heap and thus is not in and of itself a member of the class that resides in the stack.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Subtype vs Subclass</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Basically, a derived type that breaks the Liskov substitution principle is not a proper subtype. For example, suppose I have a base class called Duck and it has a function called quack() which is supposed to print out a message "quack". Then if I have a derived type called ToyDuck that has a quack() function that sometimes doesn't print out the message (if it has run out of batteries), it has broken a guarantee in the base class and is not a proper subtype. Specifically this is a case of the rule that we're only allowed to strengthen postconditions, but ToyDuck's quack() function weakened them.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Let's say you have a class <tt>rectangle</tt>, and a class <tt>square</tt> that inherits from rectangle:</p>

<pre>class Rectangle {<br />public:<br />	Rectangle() : width(0), height(0) {}		<br />	void set_width(int width) {<br />		this-&gt;width = width;<br />	}<br />	void set_height(int height) {<br />		this-&gt;height = height;<br />	}<br />	int get_area() {<br />		return width * height;<br />	}<br />private:<br />	int width;<br />	int height;<br />};</pre>
<p>However, for square, whenever we set the height or width, we would want to make sure that the other sides change accordingly to keep it a square.</p>
<pre>class Square : public Rectangle {<br />public:<br />	void set_width(int width) {<br />		this-&gt;width = width;<br />		this-&gt;height = height;<br />	}<br /><br />	void set_height(int height) {<br />		this-&gt;height = height;<br />		this-&gt;width = width;<br />	}<br />}</pre>
<p>Say we write a piece of code in <tt>main</tt> to test that <tt>Rectangle</tt> works:</p>
<pre>int main() {<br />	Rectangle rect;<br />	rect.set_height(5);<br />	rect.set_width(4);<br /><br />	if (rect.get_area() != 20) {<br />		cout &lt;&lt; "Invalid area." &lt;&lt; endl;<br />		assert(0);<br />	}<br />}</pre>
<p>By the Liskov Substitution Principle, a square is a subtype if it can be fully substituted in with no bad side effects whatsoever. Even though Square is a subclass here, it is <strong>not</strong> a subtype because when <tt>rect.set_width(4)</tt> is called, the area would be 16 – the code wouldn't work the same way as it did for <tt>Rectangle.</tt></p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
copy constructor Vs Assignment operator</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If it's part of a declaration, passing a parameter by value, or returning by value, the copy constructor is used. If you're doing an assignment expression, the assignment operator is used.</p>

<p>The only tricky case is something like </p>
<p>MyClass x;</p>
<p>MyClass y = x;</p>

<p>Even though you see an "=" sign, it's part of a declaration and the copy constructor is still used.</p>

<p>Another general rule you can use is to think about whether the destination of the copy existed previously. If it didn't, you need to "construct" it and thus the copy constructor is used.

<p>I know that destructors have to be virtual in polymorphism.</p>

<p>When the destructor is run, the virtual destructor for that derived class is run and then moves backwards to the base class.</p>

<p>For normal virtual functions, doesn't it just run the dynamic type virtual function? (Doesn't call the previous parent classes virtual functions)</p>

<p>Is this just a special case for virtual destructors or is my understanding of virtual functions incorrect?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Confused about virtual destructors</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I believe if destructors aren't virtual they will run from the derived classes upwards. If they are virtual, then it will run just the destructor for the dynamic type.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>If the destructor is not virtual then it will just run the static type of the object and then any parent class destructors if applicable. If the destructor is virtual then the dynamic type destructor is run followed by any parent class destructors is applicable.</p>

<p>example</p>
<p>cow class inherits from  mammal class which in turn inherits from animal class</p>
<p>the class hierarchy looks like this </p>
<p>animal</p>
<p>    ^</p>
<p>     |</p>
<p>mammal</p>
<p>    ^</p>
<p>     |</p>
<p>   cow</p>

<p>mammal* ptr = new Cow();</p>
<p>delete ptr;</p>

<p>if the destructor was not virtual then only the mammal destructor then the animal destructor would run because that is the static type of the pointer, if the destructor was virtual then the cow destructor (dynamic type) would run then the mammal destructor and finally the animal destructor would run.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yep to both of those!!</p>

<p>and I will leave you with this last tinbit of knowledge. virtual is inherited, so if animal had a function virtual void talk() and you overrode it in cow you wouldn't need to type virtual void talk() in the cow class and it would still be virtual, but typing virtual is just a nice style thing</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok thank you!!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ohh ok, so basically destructors will always run going all the way back to the base class but where it starts depends on whether it's virtual or not/static or dynamic type?</p>

<p>Also, just making sure my understanding of virtual is correct: if I called a virtual function implemented in cow</p>
<p>for example:</p>
<pre>virtual void talk() {cout &lt;&lt; "moo" &lt;&lt; endl;} </pre>

<p>and in int main() </p>
<pre>ptr -&gt; talk();</pre>
<p>then it would print out </p>
<p>moo</p>
<p>because it's talking the dynamic type of the ptr?  </p>

<p>it looks like your return types don't match. looks like the operator= function returns a reference to a Person (this is different than a memory address) and you are trying to assign a Person reference to a Person pointer variable</p>

overloaded operators inheritance</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>No. If class B is a subtype of class A, class B does not inherit the overload operators from class A.</p>

<p>Like constructors, the generic overload operators are automatically given to classes if they are not defined. This is why you don't have to define *(multiplication) to use it in a class. So B would have technically inherited operators from the compiler unless you specifically define the operators in class B. </p>

<p>How are we supposed to know that copyAllLayers() does this for us?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Monster prac problem (7 layer dip)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For an overloaded assignment operator you need to get rid of the existing piece of memory in "this" before you copy everything from rhs.</p>

<p>There are a variety of ways you could have done this. In this case, remove_Foodif was called with a pred that has no input, that is because we don't need a specific restriction to remove the food, we just need to get rid of it.</p>

<p>You're right, we don't know if copyAllLayers sets the topLayer of "this" to the correct food (this would be a good question to ask the GSI). Therefore, you could use the code you have to set topLayer to point to the correct food. </p>

<p>For the MonsterArmy problem, I'm still a little bit confused as to how we would decide how to implement the generate_reversed_copy() function using the iterator without understanding the implementation of the add_monster function? Thanks.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Spring 2a</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>All that you need to know is how print works.  Since you know that it prints off monsters in the order they were added, you know that you just have to make a function that adds the monsters to an army in the reverse order that they are in the original list.</p>

<p>For example, I imagine that add_monster is Insert_front and then picture Monster army as a singly linked list.  This makes sense because you don't have the ability to traverse backwards and that is the reason for needing the generate_reversed_copy().</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I did a really poor implementation using 3 iterators to essentially recreate the decrement operation for a singly linked list and started from end() and went to begin().</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>you could also create an array on the heap that holds the monsters, iterator backwards through the array inserting each monster, and then delete the array.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, that made sense to me when I was working on the problem. The only part that confuses me is how to take the monsters starting from the "back."</p></TEXT>

<p>Let's say you have virtual and pure virtual functions in a base class and then you implement them in a derived class and then you make a derived class from that derived class that only needs to reimplement some of the functions implemented in the first derived class.

 <TEXT>
virtual and pure virtual functions in derived class</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'd say yes because every function is inherited in the derived class</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so just to clarify you are talking about something like this </p>
<p>Animal (base class) </p>
<p>Mammal (derived class)</p>
<p>Cow (derived derived class)</p>
<p>and you want to call a function that is only implemented in Mammal using a Cow instance? </p>

<p>There is only one version of this function and the Cow class inherits that one version. It doesn't matter if that function is virtual or not because Cow isn't overriding it so the compiler doesn't have to choose which version to use because there is only one version in Mammal.</p>

<p>So to answer your question yes you can do it and yes it will use the Mammal version of the function.</p>

<p>you can always double check all of this by coding up a super simple quick example with a bunch of void functions that just print what class they are from like this.</p>
<pre>class Animal<br />{<br />public:<br />	virtual void talk() = 0;<br />};<br /><br />class Mammal:public Animal<br />{<br />public:<br />	virtual void talk()//implementing pure virtual function from Animal<br />	{<br />		cout &lt;&lt; "I am a mammal "&lt;&lt; endl;<br />	}<br />	virtual void mammal_stuff()//new function declared in Mammal class<br />	{<br />		cout &lt;&lt; "doing mammal stuff " &lt;&lt; endl;<br />	}<br />};<br /><br />class Cow:public Mammal<br />{<br />public:<br />	virtual void talk()//overriding pure virtual function from Animal class<br />	{<br />		cout &lt;&lt; "mooooooo" &lt;&lt; endl;<br />	}<br />};<br /><br />int main()<br />{<br />	Cow c;<br />	c.talk();<br />	c.mammal_stuff();<br />	return 0;<br />}<br /><br />//doing this because I am bored and don't want to study for my exams!! </pre>

<p>Lets say you had a Double Linked list container filled with Animal Pointers. In this container there are some animal pointers to chickens and horses. If I wanted to erase all objects that are of type chickens, (using the erase function that we had in project 5), how would I go about this?</p>

<p>My idea would to do a dynamic cast for each step in the for loop, and then erase those that don't successfully dynamically cast. But Im questioning how I would be able to keep iteratorating through the list if I erased iterators that weren't of the right type. </p>

<p>Any ideas of how to go about this problem would be greatly appreciated. </p></TEXT>

<p>Notice that they are all local variables, and when local variables got destroyed, their destructor run automatically.</p>
<p>4d starts at the end of main(), which is the place where local objects in main() got destroyed.</p>


<p>The second thing is that stacks grows down, it is "last in first out", so the last object created got destroyed first.</p>
<p>That's why you see "vidal" got destroyed first (it's destructor run first). "vidal" might not be the object the program kills the first, but it is the first object killed with "dtor run" output, so you see that it got destroyed before other object with "dtor run" output got destroyed. </p></TEXT>

<p>Sorry for the convoluted question.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Polymorphic vs. templated container</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so polymorphic containers implies that there are custom types and derived classes so generally you are going to have a contain or type base class pointer and have those pointers point to either the same type as the pointer or use the concept of polymorphism and have the pointer point to a derived class type</p>

<p>templated containers are generic contains that can hold whatever type you tell it too when you make an instance of that container. like the list in project 5, you could have that list store any one type you wanted, int, double, string, bool, Animal, Rational.... when you make an instance of list you need to tell it what type it's going to hold.</p>

<p>now you can have a templated contain that is also a polymorphic container because you declared it as a container that will hold base class pointers</p>

<p>this is incorrect there is nothing inherently polymorphic about templated containers, there is no derived classes there is just one templated class so by definition not polymorphic </p>

<p>while yes the type the container holds is decided at compile time  ( List&lt;int&gt; list1;  the &lt;int&gt; tells the compiler what type it holds ) there is no morphing happening. I can have 40 different instances of the list container and they can hold 40 different types all in the same program at the same time. But once you declare a templated list you can not change what type it holds so don't think of it as morphing</p></TEXT>

Polymorphism and Constructors</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>My understanding the same constructor only runs once.</p>
<p>So, if you call Robot's ctor inside KillerRobot's (using an initializer list), and made a KillerRobot it would run</p>
<p>Robot ctor</p>
<p>KillerRobot ctor</p>

<p>With your test statement, making a pointer doesn't call a constructor. But you made a KillerRobot on the heap so it would be the same case</p>
<p>Robot ctor</p>
<p>KillerRobot ctor</p>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ah yup!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I agree with above. I would note something i have observed. When you have a base case constructor in a derived constructor's initializer list, such as:</p>

<p>public:</p>
<p>Rabbit(string in_n, double in_p) : Animal(in_n, in_p)</p>

<p>It's usually because there are private member variables of the base class that you want to initialize. You can't simply initialize those private member variables in the derived class' constructor , but by using the base class constructor in your initializer list, you could actually initialize all the private member variables in the base classes. </p></TEXT>

Iterator invalidation question</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You're exactly correct. When you call erase, you remove the element pointed to by Iterator i. This iterator is invalidated because it points to a place in memory that used to have something there. You can no longer use it.</p>

<p>If you want to keep going, you need to increment Iterator.</p>
<p>List&lt;T&gt;::Iterator i = list.begin();</p>

<p>If you want to erase the 2nd thing in the list:</p>
<p>erase(++i);</p>

<p>Now i is invalidated here. If you want to go through the list again you'll have to make another Iterator.</p>

<p>I believe this is the same erase function we did in project 5 actually.</p></TEXT>

<p>I don't think you can do</p>
<p>temp = i + 2</p>
<p>Because in a list elements are not guaranteed to be next to each other. You would have to call ++i twice to point to the second element.</p>

<p>When you call erase, the iterator you pass in as well as any other iterators pointing to that node will become invalidated. So if temp and i pointed to the same node and you called erase(i) or erase(temp) both temp and i would become invalidated.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>what if temp pointed to the element after the one that was going to be erased?</p>

<p>Then temp is fine. In your erase function you'll have to take care of the reseting of the pointers so the list is still connected. But temp the iterator is still okay.</p></TEXT>

<p>Lets say that you have a Class A and Class B is derived from Class A.  In Class B have a custom constructor that takes in two parameters, a string and an age.  In Class A you have a custom constructor that takes in one parameter, a string.  When you do the following piece of code, how are the constructors called?  Does the constructor in A know what to do with the extra information?</p>

<p>B* b_ptr = new B( "George", 5);</p>

 <TEXT>
Constructors</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>A ctor</p>
<p>B ctor</p>

<p>I think the extra information in B doesn't come up until B's constructor is run. An A object just has a string, while a B object has a string (I'm assuming the same string as A) and an int (the age).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>so the actual order goes B's constructor is called and in turn calls A's constructor, A's constructor finishes and then B's constructor starts going through the body of the function</p>

<p>I am confused about what you're trying to ask with how does A's constructor handle the extra parameters? If that is your question then A's custom constructor only takes one parameter so it doesn't even know that there are extra parameters.</p>

<p>remember that the code is most likely going to look like this </p>
<p>B(int one, int two):A(one)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>//do constructor stuff</p>
<p>}</p>

<p>we are specifically calling A's custom constructor in the list initializer syntax area and we are only passing in the parameter that A's constructor needs and nothing more. If you do not call the parent class's constructor explicitly then the default constructor runs and remember that if you didn't implement a default constructor the compiler does it for you</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>The student answer is correct the delete command does follow the pointer and "delete" what it points to but....the technical answer to this question is a little tricky which is why we just recommend never getting into situations where you are dealing with pointers that still point to memory that was deleted.</p>

<p>so this technically works runs and compiles. the issue is the delete command doesn't actually delete anything it just tells the computer that that chunk of memory is free and can be overwritten. So it depends on what else you're doing when you run the program, it could print 5 (signifying that nothing overwrote that spot in memory yet) or you could get something different (meaning that that memory spot got  overwritten in memory)</p>

<p>I just coded this up and got it to print out 5 but that wouldn't happen every time necessarily and if I made a lot more dynamic memory between the time I called delete on ptr and when I tried to cout *other_ptr I could get different values to print depending on if the computer decides it needs/wants to reallocate that memory for something</p>

<p>the main take away from an example like this is having two pointers to the same dynamic memory is dangerous especially if you delete that dynamic memory</p></TEXT>

<p>2b: I was also thinking of running an iterator through the army, but I think if I call delete on each individual Monster in the army, I would be invalidating the iterator. </p>

<p>So you are right that if you run an iterator over the monster army to make the copy, it would result in an exact copy and not a reverse copy. So you need to find some way to implement addMonster in the reverse order of what is listed in the original Monster army. Maybe load a Monster array with Monster Army's monsters. You can easily iterate through that list</p>

<p>(New person writing here...)</p>
<p>What I did for 2a was a little tricky. I had a way that used a few variables and a coupe of embedded for loops. The idea is that I made the iterator point to the last Monster in the MonsterArmy, then I dereferenced that iterator and added the *Monster that it returns to my new army. Then I made it point to the 2nd to last Monster, then 3rd to last, etc. and added those Monsters to my new army. It's kind of complicated to explain without explicitly giving you my answer, which I'm not 100% is correct anyways. For 2b you should make a pointer to a victim to eventually delete, then move the iterator, then delete the victim. </p></TEXT>

<p>1d) C - When the destructors run, the correct destructors will not be identified at compile time (since they are based on dynamic memory). Thus, the program will need to choose the correct destructors at runtime, meaning that they will need to be virtual.</p>

<p>The destructor isn't being called in the first instance because f1 is simply a pointer to a dynamic Fruit object that lives on the heap. For a destructor of a dynamically allocated object to be called, you have to write the delete keyword when you're done using the pointer. </p>

<p>So you write:</p>

<p>delete f1;</p>

<p>and you will see the destructor being called. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Because you have an actual fruit object, not a pointer to a fruit.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Alexandra is correct</p>
<p>it's all about scope resolution, local variables go out of scope/get destroyed when the function returns so destructors will run automatically at the end of a function if they are on the stack, The life time of an object on the heap is as long as you want it to be so in order to get rid of it we need to specifically call delete on a pointer that points to it and only when that happens will a destructor run for that object</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How come in the second example we don't delete anything yet it still destructs? I</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>exactly so the <strong>pointer</strong> f1 gets destroyed when the function is done but because the actual fruit object lives on the heap the actual fruit object lives forever until delete is called on a pointer to it</p>

<p>whereas in the second example where f1 is actually a fruit object it goes out of scope when the function is done and the destructor is run automatically</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I guess the reason I'm confused is because in lecture we were told that for local variables the destructor runs whenever the variable goes out of scope..in the first example isn't *f1 technically a local variable? Why is it then following the rules of a dynamic variables in terms of when its destructor runs? </p>

<p>when they said "local variable destructors run when it goes out of scope" are they only talking about the local variables which themselves are instances of a class as opposed to pointing to an instance of a class?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>yea</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So basically every time you create a class that on the <strong>stack </strong>that is a local variable…the destructor will run on it when it goes out of scope?!</p></TEXT>

<p>For this question, I know that there is a problem with the line node-&gt;prev = 0 (Prev is always null, which messes up the reverse print function), but I just want to verify that my reasoning for the buggy input make sense. I guess that the regular print will work fine, but the reverse print will only print the last element, as prev is never anything but null for any previous node. Am I on the right track?</p></TEXT>

<p>downcasting requires the use of dynamic_cast whereas upcasting can be done with either static_cast or dynamic_cast. you can cast the static type and the dynamic type up the subtype tree but only the dynamic type can be cast down</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>static casts happen at compile time while dynamic casts happen during run time and everything that Jason said was also correct</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks. I guess I meant more as: in the context of this problem, can someone explain what happens between compile time and run time? </p>

<p>I thought of it as *ptr is Animal * at compile time. And then it downcasts(?) to be Bird* at run-time?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Ok so what if we had code that looked something like this: </p>
<pre>class Animal {<br />public:<br />  virtual void talk() {<br />    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello I am an animal\n";<br />  }<br />};<br /><br />class Dog : public Animal {<br />public:<br />  void talk() {<br />    cout &lt;&lt; "Hello I am a dog\n";<br />  }<br />};</pre>
<p>Notice how the talk function has virtual in front of it in the Animal class, but not the Dog class. What difference would this make? In one of the practice exams, some of the code contained something like this where matching functions in derived classes did not contain the word virtual but the parent class did. Is there a formal C++ definition of virtual that would help to understand situations like this? Also what would happen if the derived class function had virtual and the parent class function didnt?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
virtual functions - definition of virtual?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So if a base class has a virtual function and a class that derives from that base has a function with the exact same prototype (return type, name, and arguments) then that function is a virtual function too, even if the keyword "virtual" is not there. It's implied. For example: </p>
<pre>class Base {
public: 
    virtual void hello() { cout &lt;&lt; "Hello Base" &lt;&lt; endl; }
};
class Derived : public Base {
public: 
    void hello() { cout &lt;&lt; "Hello Derived" &lt;&lt; endl; } // the keyword "virtual" is optional. Either way works!
};
int main() { 
    Base *b = new Derived;
    b-&gt;hello(); // Should print "Hello Derived"
    delete b;
}
</pre>
<p>Now on the other hand if the virtual keyword was removed from the Base function, or if the virtual keyword was only present in front of the Derived function, then Hello Base would be printed because the static type of b is Base. The virtual keyword in front of the hello function is Base basically enables run-time checking of types. Hopefully that helps!</p></TEXT>

<p>Whoops yes you're right Anonymous, my bad. Thanks for the heads up - fixed it!</p></TEXT>

<p>The Derived class doesn't mention it's a public Base, though.  Doesn't that matter?</p></TEXT>

<p>My question is similar to the previous piazza post regarding virtual functions, but with destructors. What difference does it make when you have virtual in front of the base class destructor and not the derived class destructor? And the other way around? Should they both always run because the derived destructor runs, all the way down to the base class destructor? Is the word virtual even needed?</p></TEXT>

Virtual destructors</TEXT>

<p>If a destructor is virtual, the destructor of the dynamic type at runtime is ran, followed by any parent classes above this class.</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>yea this one is confusing…can someone please put up a picture of how the heap and stack would look like?

 <TEXT>
<p>I know destructors are <strong>needed</strong> when a class allocates memory dynamically…however if a class is not dynamically allocating memory it doesn't need a destructor? However, doesn't the compiler add one for you if you don't explicitly add one for EVERY class? Im asking because in a few practice exams I saw that there are classes which don't use any dynamic memory yet they still have destructors with cout statements and all…so does this mean that they do exist in every class but do nothing basically?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Destructors in every class?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Not sure if this helps, but if the destructors don't do anything else except cout and the default destructor stuff, then their purpose could just be to show what order the destructors are run in.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, every class is given a default destructor if you don't specify one.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>well yea but the fact tha the destructors are even running in a class that has no dynamic memory shows that EVERY class has a a destructor right? whether it is explicitly implemented or not</p></TEXT>

<p>Well, if this is any help:</p>

<p>look up the green rd park and ride. It's free, so that's about the best information I can give you as far as where you can park. The 22 South Connector gets there at 9:47 and gets to Pierpont Commons at about 9:53. I'm going to be riding that bus in the morning so if you're there at that time, I can direct you to where the Chrysler Center is (right next to Pierpont). This bus passes right in front of it when it gets on Bonisteel so it's hard to miss. Also, the bus drivers are always helpful so if you decide to get there for the 10:17 one then they'll be able to tell you where everything is.</p>

<p>There's also a Student Orange lot at Baits I (can take Bursley-Baits from there to Pierpont, buliding next to Pierpont), and a Student Orange lot at Heyward and Hubbard that's easily visible, and one north of Heyward that's less easily visible (can take Northwood from there). The Park and Ride lot is 2 miles away, this lot is less then 1 - and designated for Orange holders.</p>

<p>Based on the summary, it looks like 27/130 of the points come from catching buggy test cases, so there are either 27 or 28 (if they allow you to miss one like in P4) buggy test cases to catch.</p></TEXT>

<p>What does the Survey credit in the gradebook stand for? The survey for lab? How much it counts in the final grades? Thank you!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Survey credit</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It was near the beginning of the semester, just a ordinary survey. It's 1% extra credit.</p>

<p>Edit: There are also the surveys at the end of the semester (course evaluation and Qualtrics survey) that were posted about a week ago. I'm not sure if that was included in the grade on CTools.</p>

<p>------------</p>

<p>I think the one that says "survey credit" is what will count. At the beginning, the "Extra credit" one was just if you did that one beginning of term survey. The parenthesis around that score means it doesn't count anymore. It's probably one point if you did the beginning of term survey and another point if you did BOTH the end of term survey and the CTools course evaluation. For the end of term stuff, I think if you only did one or the other, you get no credit.</p></TEXT>

<p>@1229 the distribution for everything except the curve for the class is up</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I was wondering, is there a chance for us to pick up the final exam or file for regrading?</p>

</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Regrade for final</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Grades are due noon tomorrow, most likely not.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>^ In other classes (for example, orgo), if you pick up your exam after grades are submitted, they will consider a regrade request only if it would make a difference in your final grade.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Grades are due noon tomorrow, most likely not.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm thinking we'll have this information later today/ tomorrow morning</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Yeah, seriously. It's been three days since we had the exam. Relax.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Now, that would actually be helpful if A) we knew when/if we could pick up the final, and B) if we knew the cut-offs to see if "it would make a difference in your final grade."</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Will the extra credit be accounted for before or after the curve?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Extra credit</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In lecture, Professor DeOrio said it would be included after the curve.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>In lecture, Professor DeOrio said it would included after the curve.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How will the curve work? I know the average is usually around a low B, but what about the grades around that? Is it by standard deviation, or is it a straight difference in percentage from the average?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Curve</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>The syllabus says that if you are within one standard deviation of the median, you can expect to pass. So if you did 1 standard deviation below the median on everything, you should probably be guaranteed a C.</p>

<p>Based on @1229, my calculation for one standard deviation below the median is 66% overall, not including the extra credit. My calculation for the median is 80%.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>*from, not between</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>syllabus said median</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I cant find where it says that.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>"In the past, the median student has received a grade in the low B range, and students within one standard deviation of average can generally expect to pass."</p>

<p>i guess actually they use a blend of both?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>You do calculate standard deviation using the mean. However, if you look at a Gaussian distribution or bell curve, the peak would be the median. 68% of the people scored within one standard deviation above or below the median, not mean.</p>

<p>Often times when it comes to grades, the median is higher than the mean because there is a greater spread on the lower side of the median.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>This means 84% of the people will pass this class.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is it a standard deviation between the mean or the median? Because stddev is calculated with the mean, right? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>For the median, I took the medians of everything and multiplied it by the weight for our grade and summed them up.</p>

<p>$$5\times 1.00 \text{ (labs)}+4\times 1.00 \text{ (p1)}+9\times 0.92 \text{ (p2)}+ 9\times 0.77 \text{ (p3)}+ \\
9\times 0.90 \text{ (p4)}+9\times 0.86 \text{ (p5)}+25\times 0.81 \text{ (midterm)}+30\times 0.65 \text{ (final)} \\
\approx 80$$</p>

<p>I assumed everybody got 100 on the labs.</p>

<p>To calculate 1 stddev below, I took the medians and subtracted 1 stddev and did the same thing.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>By my calculations, one stddev below is a 62%. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I just double checked and still got what I originally had. But regardless, I'd almost always rather underestimate my grade rather than overestimate.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How did you calculate what the median and stddev was?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Well after calculating my grade, I am pretty sure I am not going to pass this class, for those who we're successful, do you have any advice for the next time around?</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
office hours. GSIs and IAs are lonely and want to help you learn! :)</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It's true.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I did quite a bit better on the final exam than the midterm. What I did differently for the second half of the class that I think helped was review the lectures from the most recent two lectures every weekend.</p>

<p>For example, we would have a lecture on Monday and Wednesday. I would always go to those lectures and do the exercises during class. Then on Friday, Saturday, and/or Sunday, I would go back and watch the Blue Review of those lectures and do all the exercises again. It really helped me get the concepts into my head. I believe this change in my studying techniques helped me improve from midterm to final.</p>

<p>Also, I started enjoying the class more once I started this new strategy. Because I was finally understanding the concepts decently, it made the class less intimidating, and that certainly helps you hate the class less (assuming you have a dislike for it in the first place).</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I can't say that I've been largely successful in this class myself, but one thing I don't think I took full advantage of was the 280 community. Peers and staff seem more than willing to help one another, and I probably should've gotten more involved. I studied on my own, did the projects on my own, and didn't attend office hours. I also stopped going to lecture towards the end. Definitely, for sure, I would've been more successful (and probably more happy) if I put myself into the 280 group.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Labs were very good, in my opinion. Only 4 people showed up regularly to mine, and it was great because our GSI really enjoyed helping each of us individually, as well as address us as a little group.</p>

<p>I went to lecture every day and took handwritten notes. That way I didn't get distracted with a laptop and handwriting really helps you remember things better! I also met a study buddy in class, so we studied together and talked about the examples. Really try the examples that are in the lecture, don't just talk about it. Write stuff down! Great practice for exams.</p>

<p>I usually kept up with piazza, reading all questions just in case someone though of something I didn't. Saved me some points on projects for sure.</p>

<p>I went to offices hours probably 2 or 3 times a week. If I didn't have time for all of that that week, I would go at least 1 time. I scheduled "James' OH" on my calendar weekly, that way it was in my schedule and a thing I told myself I would do. Even if I didn't have a certain question yet, I would work on the project there so I had a handy IA or GSI if I got stuck. Starting early was the best decision I made, and I should end up with an A in this class, something I am very proud of! Thank you to all IAs and GSIs, you guys are really amazing.</p>

<p>Best wishes to you and kudos for wanting to do better next time!</p>

 <TEXT>
<p>In my experience writing code was probably the most important thing to doing (reasonably) well in the class. Lectures are useful and important, but they don't mean much unless you know the language well enough to code it on your own when we get to projects and exams. The labs were really good about this, and even though my section at least typically went over the answers at the end of the period, I learned a lot by doing them on my own and making stupid mistakes.</p>

<p>Also helping other people on Piazza was a huge bonus. Seeing other people make mistakes is a great way to learn, almost as good as making the mistake yourself. I had a teacher who said once that true test of when you've learned something is when you can explain it to someone else.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Wooo, 67 with extra credit. We're gonna make it, guys. </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What about 65% without the extra credit?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>they said within 1 stddev of the median, which I calculated to be roughly 66%. but the calculation with using @1229 isn't the most accurate</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How is it not the most accurate? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>a lot of students dropped the class since the beginning, and they're not going to count those students into the average/median.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Oh really? How do you know that?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>615 students submitted something for p1, 596 students took the midterm, 547 students took the final</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I mean, how do you know they don't compute the averages based on everyone who completed that specific project / test? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Deorio mentioned in @1229 that those who drop are not included in the final curve calculations.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What is the 66% u calculated?</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
so, for the running totals that we posted on piazza, we do calculate it for everyone who did the project/took the test. HOWEVER, for the final grade, we only take into account the people who completed the course.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I took each median and subtracted one stddev from it, then multipled them by their weight and summed them up. For example, the final had a 65% median and 15% stddev. It is 30% of our grade. So I then did $$30\times (0.65-0.15)$$, for example.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>So 66% is the cutoff for a C?</p>
</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I'm sure this will probably be answered later / tomorrow, but will we be allowed to view our final exams and have chances for a regrade  if need be? </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
We have not calculated the cutoffs yes as not everyone has taken the final. We will let you know when grades are released.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks Alyssa!  </p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What is the borderline of C and C-?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>i think, based on the medians posted on @1229, the median overall grade is around a 79-80%. usually, the median is set at a "low B" (according to the syllabus). I'm not sure if that means a B- or a straight B, though.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
We don't know because grades won't be calculated until tomorrow.</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What percentage do you think a B will start at? like where will the B- stop and become a B?</p>

<p>honestly, i was a bit irked that someone had to keep coming in every 5-10 minutes to correct a typo. they weren't very bad errors, and it wouldn't have made a big difference in the score results, but it just felt like they could've put a bit more care into the exams. of course, my opinion.</p></TEXT>

<p>if up to this point you have been doing cout debugging and don't know how to use gdb or the built in debuggers for visual studio, xcode, or eclipse spend the break getting familiar with them, it will make debugging so much faster, trust me. <strong>This in my opinion is the most important thing</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>my biggest regret when I took 281 was not starting the projects early don't wait until the last four days and not sleep, the projects will take you 30-50 hours and there are no partners so plan for that. office hours are always a big help, but be prepared to ask more conceptual questions rather than how do I code x, y, and z. this is just the nature of the class and the fact that you don't start with any starter code and creating the entire program is up to you so most people's code will look different and the gsi probably did it or thought about it a different way as well. you should read the specs immediately and think about them for a day or two before you write code. come up with a plan of attack before you even type #include this will save you a lot of time in the long run so hopefully you don't code your self into a corner.</p>

<p>Everyone will be talking about the leader board, don't worry about that and don't worry about making your code the most efficient thing in the world right off the bat. Code it the way that makes sense to you and write test cases, then see if it's fast enough in the auto grader, if it is good job you're done if not go back and think about your design choices and see where you can improve things. <br /><br />the exams are tough but find at least one buddy in the class and study with them, take turns explaining concepts and try to teach each other at every step.<br /><br />good luck and remember the coding is fun even if you have to debug. <br /><br />and as for the comments about the exam, we did several edits on them for both clarity and content but sometimes even we gsi's make human mistakes and miss things. someone might come up with a great idea for a question but turning that idea into a working problem is really hard.</p></TEXT>

Final regrade</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>How do you know you will need one if you haven't even looked at your graded final?</p>

<p>Anyways, @2864 says you can pick your exam up next semester if you want it. If you do need a regrade that will probably make a difference in your course grade, I don't think next semester is too late if you ask for it within the first week or two. They can still change a grade that was already submitted if they do have a valid reason.</p></TEXT>

What is the policy regarding retaking EECS 280 if we passed?</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
retaking EECS 280</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think the policy as of this fall is that anybody can take the class twice overall. Each time you get a grade or take a W, that counts as once.</p>

<p>In my personal opinion, it may not be worth your time. Whether you're trying to get a job, go to medical school, etc., if you did poorly in a class but still passed, I think they'd rather just see you do better in a subsequent class (i.e. 281 in this case) than retake the class. Somebody else may have a different opinion though.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Mine is showing up on my unofficial transcript but not in Enrollment &gt; View my grades, if that helps</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I still haven't gotten either lol. THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Is there a certain spot to find your final grades in Wolverine Access? Or is it just your unofficial transcript?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Cutoffs are always anonymous.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>We don't publish grade cutoffs.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>What were the cutoffs?</p>

<p>Thanks for grading everything so quickly!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
shoutout to the teaching staff</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>Thanks for also being patient with our anxiety and jitteriness!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>It was a marathon weekend of grading! Perhaps the only thing worse than taking the test is grading it. :)<br /><br />We're also all students ourselves (or have been sometime in the past), and we can identify with the anxiety of waiting for grades.</p>

<p>Thanks all for a great semester. Have a nice break and best of luck in your future endeavors!</p></TEXT>

<p>For those of you who did the surveys for the extra credit right before exams, is it indicated on your gradebook? I did them, but my survey extra credit still shows us as a 0/2.</p>

<p>Yes, I did forward the CTools evaluation confirmation to the eecs-evals email.</p>

<p>Edit: Resolved, just sent an email to the eecs instructors.</p></TEXT>

 <TEXT>
<p>Yes, mine shows up as 2/2 and I did the surveys at the beginning and end of the year.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I think if you did the beginning of term survey, you would get 1. At the end of the term, you would also get 1 if you did BOTH the survey and the CTools course evaluation. For the end of term stuff, I'm almost positive that if you only did one but not the other, you would not get credit for that.</p>

<p>It is also possible that you needed to do both the beginning of term and end of term stuff to get the credit. If you missed anything, you would then get no credit in this case.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I filled out the end-of-term survey twice, never got an email in my inbox that I could forward to the EECS department, ad gave up.  I got a B in the class overall, though, so I decided it wasn't worth pursuing.  I did get a 1% bonus for the beginning-of-term survey, though, which worked exactly as expected.</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I guess this is just a curious question, I'm an EE and I have no time to take any further CS classes, but I have really enjoyed it. Does anyone have any advice or opinions on what good independent projects would be to keep up my CS skills?</p></TEXT>

Programming advice</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
Project Euler, if you're into the mathy side of things
-------------------------
<p>This is a bit complicated, depending on your preferences. Here's the best tidbit of advice I can give you: try to develop something you enjoy. If you can push yourself to improve your skills just to "improve", 99% of the time you'll burn out far sooner than later.<br /><br />So...</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1: What to focus on? Category-wise</strong></p>
<p>Pick something that interests you. Mobile development? Why not. Game development? Sure, plenty of resources for that. Web app? Definitely. The point is to choose something that interests you. Without that, you won't know how to move forward. Even if you want to learn Java, you have to still <em>decide</em> on that.<br /><br /><strong>Question 2: Get a bunch of resources</strong></p>
<p>Say you want to mobile development. Well, you gotta start somewhere. This will differ depending on your focus (which is one reason why you should pick something first). For Android dev, you could look up IDEs, emulators, just-starting tutorials, Youtube tutorials, and more. The main thing you want to do is try to run <em>something</em>. If it's a website, make a page that says "Hello world" with fancy colors. For mobiles, create a two-page app, with one saying "Welcome" and the other saying "Hello world."</p>

<p>Essentially, you need the resources to at least create the very basics. Once you get the very basics (ie, just running your code), you can try to create your own projects.</p>
<p> <br /><strong>Question 3: Goals</strong></p>
<p>This is where you want to be. It's alright for your ultimate goal to be just "improve my CS skills" but you need to have some goals between then and now. First off, start off with a <strong>small</strong> manageable project, no matter what you're developing. Many people tend to just start off with massive first projects. Great ideas are amazing, but we all need to start somewhere. I've personally spoken with some people, and they were even working in a team with others on a massive, amazing first project. However, the project was taking so long without any releases (no sharing, no satisfaction, no pride, no rekindling the fire to work on the project) that he just quit.</p>

<p>Try to start small, then work towards something amazing. Don't have an awesome idea? That's alright, try to create that first small project. However, try to get creative and think of something you would <em>enjoy</em> making.</p>

<p>As this is probably very disjointed (someone feel free to edit this), here goes a quick overview:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Choose</strong> something to focus on</li><li>Find out <strong>how</strong> to learn about that focus</li><li>Create a few goals or stepping stones between now and then- but first start off small then big</li></ol>

<p>Say I want to learn mobile development:</p>
<ul><li>Chose Android development</li><li>Found the official dev links, an awesome beginner's tutorial, and a whole lot of Youtube videos. Plus, many other tutorials.</li><li>First, I followed a bunch of those beginning tutorials and ran my own first Android apps. Then, I created a custom test app that displays everything I learned in all the focused tutorials. Afterwards, I remade that app into a "professional" layout showcase app. Finally, I moved on to creating an app with a team (and got a job for Android development)</li></ul>
<p><br />-------------</p>

<p>And a small tidbit: If you can, join a Project team on campus, preferably something that's more CS related (such as, solar car team vs UM::Autonomy or MAAV). That way, you'll be surrounded by others with experience and have a common goal to work towards.</p>

<p>Finally, apply and go to MHacks. Even if you don't make anything, check out other people. Plus, tons and tons of free stuff.<br />Not joking about the free stuff.</p>
<p>Also, MHacks has a ton of resources at hand, including top-notch mentors, amazing companies (FB, Microsoft, Google to name a few), and awesome hardware (Occulus Rift, Pebbles, drones, etc).<br /><br />If you need actual ideas, feel free to post a follow up with a category of interest.</p></TEXT>

<p>Wow. Can I have permission to steal this and repost in the future? We have this sort of question show up on Piazza regularly at the end of the term, but I don't think I've ever seen such a great answer.</p></TEXT>

<p>I had gotten to thinking about tail call recursion and compiler optimization of it today, and realized it's maybe not always safe to do.</p>
<p>Looking at clang's output (LLVM 3.5 if it matters) I see for a trivial example it does indeed optimize away tail call recursion:</p>
<pre>int factTail_helper(int n, int soFar){<br />  if (n == 1) { return soFar; }<br />  else {<br />    return factTail_helper(n-1, n*soFar);<br />  }<br />}</pre>
<p>becomes the following:</p>
<pre>__Z15factTail_helperii:                 ## @_Z15factTail_helperii<br />	.cfi_startproc<br />## BB#0:<br />	pushq	%rbp<br />Ltmp2:<br />	.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16<br />Ltmp3:<br />	.cfi_offset %rbp, -16<br />	movq	%rsp, %rbp<br />Ltmp4:<br />	.cfi_def_cfa_register %rbp<br />	jmp	LBB0_2<br />	.align	4, 0x90<br />LBB0_1:                                 ## %tailrecurse<br />                                        ##   in Loop: Header=BB0_2 Depth=1<br />	imull	%edi, %esi<br />	decl	%edi<br />LBB0_2:                                 ## %tailrecurse<br />                                        ## =&gt;This Inner Loop Header: Depth=1<br />	cmpl	$1, %edi<br />	jne	LBB0_1<br />## BB#3:                                ## %tailrecurse._crit_edge<br />	movl	%esi, %eax<br />	popq	%rbp<br />	retq<br />	.cfi_endproc</pre>
<p>It's straightforward to see the base case where we compare against 1, jump otherwise to the integer multiply and decrement of n, and loop as needed for the recursive case.</p>
<p>But because this is C++, we can break this fragile optimization rather easily: for example, make the function-scope ending brace do something significant by allocating an object on the stack that has a nontrivial destructor.</p>

<p>Are there any more subtle things we should watch out for because they would cause such an optimization to not be done? Is there a safe way to still optimize here, even though we potentially have a destructor to worry about?</p>

<p>(Hopefully such a question is not totally ill suited to piazza even though the semester is over! Thanks for everything, GSIs, professors, and students alike :D)</p></TEXT>

<p>The response to this stack overflow question does a pretty good job exploring the issue.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, what were the criteria for receiving an A+ in this class as opposed to an A?</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
A vs A+</TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>We don't publish the information about grades, sorry!</p></TEXT>
 <TEXT>
<p>I would like to see the mistakes I made, curiosity is killing me. </p>

<p>If possible, could I see my exam?</p></TEXT>

Where do we go to pick up our final exams?</TEXT>
