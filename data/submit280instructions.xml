<P>submit280 project submissions script: </P>

<P>The submission script lives in our course directory (/afs/umich.edu/class/eecs280), and is called 
&quot;submit280&quot;. 
The syntax for running the script is:
</P>

<P> /afs/umich.edu/class/eecs280/submit280 &lt;projnum&gt; &lt;files...&gt; where &lt;projnum&gt; is the project number, and &lt;files&gt; is the list of files that you are submitting. To use it, you must be in the CAEN environment. </P>

<P>First, type in the following commands: % cd % cd &lt;path-to-your-project-directory&gt; % ls p1.cpp</P>

<P> (this will also list out the remaining files in your directory)</P>

<P> then type this in to submit your file for project 1:
 % /afs/umich.edu/class/eecs280/submit280 1 p1.cpp
 It'll ask you something like this:
</P>

<P> p1.cpp Testing with published test case Submit these files? Type y or RETURN to submit, anything else to abort: Press enter to submit your file.</P>

<P> Submission received.

</P>

<P>The submit280 script performs some simple checks. </P>

<P>your program does not compile or pass the published test cases, you can submit, but you are unlikely to earn much in the way of a score for the project. </P>

<P>PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THESE WARNINGS! </P>

<P>Submissions are copied into a dropbox directory in AFS. It is set up so that you can insert new files, but no one can read anyone else's files, and no one can modify or delete even their own. This is the only place submissions are stored, so be *sure* to keep a copy in your own AFS directory, just in case. </P>
