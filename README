                      Piazza Question Answering System
              Designed for EECS 280 at the University of Michigan
================================================================================
Developed from the open source OpenEphyra Question Answering System,
PiazzaQA is designed for computer science courses that make use of Piazza
as an open class forum. 

PiazzaQA is designed to respond appropriately to student questions by using
course documents and previous piazza posts as reference material. This QA system
is capable of referencing most related pizza questions and class documents while
also citing the most related answer from said sources.
