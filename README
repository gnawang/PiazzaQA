                      Piazza Question Answering System

================================================================================
Developed from the open source OpenEphyra Question Answering System,
PiazzaQA is designed for computer science courses that make use of Piazza
as an open class forum. 

PiazzaQA is designed to respond appropriately to student questions by using
course documents and previous piazza posts as reference material.

Getting Started:
----------------

If you just like to run OpenEphyra in command line mode, try the following:

- Go to the folder 'scripts'.
- Execute OpenEphyra.sh (Unix, Linux, and Mac OS) or OpenEphyra.bat (Windows).
- Type in a factoid question, 'LIST:' followed by a list question, or 'exit'.

The only system requirements are a Java runtime environment (version 1.5 or
later) and about 1 GB of free RAM.
